      "abstract_en": "Motion tokenization is a key component of generalizable motion models, yet most existing approaches are restricted to species-specific skeletons, limiting their applicability across diverse morphologies. We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

      "abstract_en": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.   To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.   Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.   By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants."

      "abstract_en": "Safe and computationally efficient local planning for mobile robots in dense, unstructured human crowds remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function."

      "abstract_en": "In this paper, we introduce DynaRetarget, a complete pipeline for retargeting human motions to humanoid control policies. The core component of DynaRetarget is a novel Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization (SBTO) framework that refines imperfect kinematic trajectories into dynamically feasible motions. SBTO incrementally advances the optimization horizon, enabling optimization over the entire trajectory for long-horizon tasks. We validate DynaRetarget by successfully retargeting hundreds of humanoid-object demonstrations and achieving higher success rates than the state of the art. The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection."

      "abstract_en": "Being able to simulate the outcomes of actions in varied environments will revolutionize the development of generalist agents at scale. However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models."

Figure 1. Efficient motion transfer with FastVMT: By eliminating redundant attention computations and reusing previously computed gradients, we achieve faster motion transfer for single- as well as multi-object motion, camera ego-motion, and complex articulations. 

## Abstract 

Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generat-ing visual content according to a text prompt while transfer-ring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Re-cent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit

gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips un-warranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43 × speedup without degrading the visual fi-delity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos. 

## 1. Introduction 

With the rapid advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), a wide range of downstream visual synthesis applications have been significantly empowered [ 3 , 4, 7, 21 , 22 , 25 – 27 ,32 , 37 – 41 , 62 ], among which motion transfer has emerged as a particularly important and intuitive paradigm. Motion transfer aims to generate a novel video by transferring the dynamics of a reference video sequence to a target sequence, while preserving the target’s appearance and semantics. For instance, the reference video might show an action sequence performed by an actor, which shall be transferred to a target subject while preserving their identity; or the reference might prescribe a particular camera path through the scene, which one would like to replicate for the target scene (see Fig. 1). In other words, motion transfer offers an intuitive interface for controllable motion synthesis, with applications ranging from movie productions and game development to digital advertising and content creation on social media platforms. Recent advances in video motion transfer increasingly leverage large, foundational generative video models [ 28 ]. These models typically employ the DiT architecture within a denoising diffusion loop 1. They are not only capable of synthesizing high-quality videos from noise, but can also be conditioned with text or image prompts to control the video style and content. A variety of motion transfer approaches have emerged that leverage these powerful visual priors, in ei-ther training-based and training-free fashion. Training-based methods ( e.g. , MotionDirector [ 85 ], MOFT [ 81 ], DeT [ 45 ]) extract the motion patterns of a specific reference video by fine-tuning the parameters of the diffusion backbone. For example, MotionDirector [ 85 ] and DreamMotion [ 14 ] adopt dual-path versions of low-rank adaptation [ 10 ] to disentangle the representations of motion and appearance in the diffu-sion DiT. Although they are capable of generating videos whose motion follows the reference, they suffer from practi-cal limitations: overfitting to every new reference video is time-consuming ( e.g. , up to 2 hours on an A100 GPU) and therefore unsuitable for open-domain and real-time settings. To achieve efficient and generally applicable motion trans-fer, attention has shifted to training-free frameworks [ 35 , 63 ,69 ]. They obviate the need for per-video fine-tuning and thus

enable significantly faster synthesis ( e.g. , ≈10 minutes on an A100 GPU). The training-free approach also exploits the gradual, iterative denoising process of contemporary video foundation models: The reference video is first inverted into the embedding space of the DiT to extract features that en-code the motion. Then the output video is synthesized by denoising diffusion, guided by both a text prompt and the gradient between the motion embeddings of the source and target video. Our work is motivated by the observation that, in exist-ing implementations of this pipeline, both the extraction of motion embedding from DiT backbone and the computa-tion of motion gradients introduce considerable redundancy. Rather elementary properties of videos, and of the associated generative process, suggest that the computational cost of training-free motion transfer can be reduced considerably. 

(i) Motion redundancy : To extract the motion embeddings from latents [ 68 ] or attention maps [ 35 ] in the inversion stage, it is not necessary to calculate pairwise similarities between all tokens of consecutive frames. Frame-to-frame motion has limited magnitude and is locally smooth, hence motion features can be computed more efficiently, see Fig. 2(a). 

(ii) Gradient redundancy : In the denoising stage, there is no need to recalculate all gradients at each timestep. We find that motion transfer is a case of “ stable gradient optimiza-tion ”. Motivated by the idea of deterministic sampling to upgrade DDPM [ 9 ] to DDIM [ 46 ], we examine the gradi-ent updates in consecutive optimization steps and observe that they tend to be similar, see Fig. 2(b). Consequently, gradients can be reused over multiple iterations. Based on these observations, FastVMT makes two contri-butions to achieve efficient motion transfer. (1) Instead of extracting motion embeddings token by token, as in DiTFlow [ 36 ], we design a sliding-window strategy that operates on downsampled attention maps and an associated corresponding window loss, to perform a more reliable and more efficient local search for motion correspondence. (2) We address gradient redundancy with a step-skipping gradient computation. Gradients are recalculated only at selected iteration steps, between those steps, the most recent values are reused so as to reduce the total number of gradient calculations and amortize them better. These two tricks enable high-fidelity video generation with camera trajectories and/or object motions according to the source video, see Fig. 1. Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that FastVMT achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, with up to 14.91 × lower latency. Furthermore, FastVMT delivers a 3.43 × speedup with minimal performance degradation, preserving near-lossless quality across various evaluation metrics when compared to the original training-free video motion transfer pipeline. 2Each token need to be

Figure 2. Motivation of our method . Training-free video motion transfer can benefit from redundancies, both at the level of the DiT architecture and of the iterative diffusion process. (a) Motion redundancy : Video motion is small and locally consistent, so a motion token in one frame will only ever match tokens in the next frame within a local neighborhood. (b) Gradient redundancy : Gradient updates in consecutive optimization steps are mostly similar (visualized here with PCA). There is no need to recompute them at every single step. 

## 2. Related work 

Text-to-video generation. Text-to-video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos by precisely matching both the visual content and motion dynamics described in the input prompt. Previous works [ 1, 6 , 8, 24 , 54 , 56 –59 , 66 , 73 –76 , 79 ] introduce temporal modules in UNet architectures to generate coherent videos. To generate complex video motion, the advancement of Diffusion Transformer-based methods for text-to-video generation exhibits superior per-formance in both spatial quality and temporal consistency. These models [ 2, 16 , 23 , 29 , 52 , 65 , 67 , 71 , 72 , 77 , 78 , 80 ]demonstrate the power of scaling transformers to produce highly realistic video clips from detailed prompts, unlocking potential for diverse downstream video generation tasks. 

Video motion transfer. Motion transfer focuses on generat-ing novel videos while transferring motion from reference videos, differing from video-to-video translation [ 19 , 31 , 84 ]by decoupling spatial appearance and temporal motion. Early approaches rely on explicit control signals such as poses [ 25 , 84 ], depths [ 44 , 64 ], and bounding boxes [ 60 ]. Training-based methods [ 14 , 30 , 31 , 43 , 48 , 49 , 82 , 83 , 85 ]employ spatial-temporal decoupled attention mechanisms by a dual-path LoRA architecture. Recent works [ 43 , 61 ]improving motion-appearance disentanglement, though they remain time-consuming and non-reusable. Training-free methods [ 5 , 11 , 12 , 17 , 35 , 47 , 50 , 63 , 70 ] extract motion embeddings during inference, with DiTFlow [ 35 ] propos-ing attention motion flow optimization. However, existing methods suffer from computational redundancy in both the architectural and diffusion process perspectives. In contrast, we first analyze the redundancy in training-free motion trans-fer and design the sliding-window motion extraction and step-skipping optimization to improve efficiency. 

## 3. Method 

Given an input video I = [ I1, ..., In], and the prompt P

describing the target video content, we aim to design an efficient training-free framework to generate a novel video 

J = [ J1, ..., Jn] following the input prompt P, while pre-serving the same camera pose changes and object motion. To achieve this, we propose FastVMT, an efficient framework using DiT-based video generative model [ 52 ] to transfer mo-tion efficiently. The pipeline of our method is shown in Fig. 4. We first analyze the existing redundancy in previous works and introduce our motivation in Sec. 3.1. The sliding-window motion extraction strategy is present in Sec. 3.2. To improve the motion consistency, we design the correspond-ing window loss in Sec. 3.3. Finally, in Sec. 3.4, we propose the step-skipping gradient optimization to ensure gradient efficiency. 

3.1. Motivation 

We summarize the two observed redundancies of state-of-the-art approaches in the training-free video motion transfer task and propose the modules to address them. 

Motion redundancy. In the inversion stage, existing training-free video motion transfer approaches [ 35 , 63 , 69 ]utilize the global token similarity to obtain the reference motion flow. Specifically, for every optimization step, each token requires calculating the similarity with all tokens in the next attention map. However, we note that every motion token will only correspond with a token in nearby regions in the next attention map. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the corre-sponding token in the dog’s nose would only appear around nearby regions rather than on the road. Therefore, such a property about temporal consistency makes it unreasonable to extract the motion flow by calculating token-by-token similarity globally. To address this, we introduce the sliding-3Time / Motion Fid.

window motion extraction strategy. Only the regional tokens are calculated for efficient motion extraction. Meanwhile, such a design enables correcting the mismatch during the motion extraction, as shown in Fig. 5, ensuring the motion consistency of generated results. 

Gradient redundancy. During the optimization process of training-free motion transfer methods, a significant compu-tational bottleneck emerges from the repetitive gradient cal-culations performed at each inner optimization step. Specif-ically, for every denoising timestep, the optimization loop performs gradient computation across all inner optimization steps to update the latent representation. However, we ob-serve that the gradient updates exhibit high similarity across consecutive optimization steps within the same denoising timestep. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the PCA analysis reveals that gradient patterns remain relatively stable across adja-cent optimization steps. Therefore, such “ stable gradient optimization ” makes it unnecessary to compute gradients at every optimization step. To address this, we introduce the step-skipping gradient optimization strategy. Only spe-cific optimization steps require gradient computation, while intermediate steps reuse cached gradients for efficient opti-mization (in Fig. 3). 

3.2. Efficient attention window 

Attention acquisition. We leverage the inherent attention mechanism within video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to extract fine-grained motion patterns, based on the premise that correlated content across video frames is naturally cap-tured by the self-attention layer’s query-key interactions. Given an input video I = [ I1, ..., In], and the prompt P

of target video content, we utilize the 3D VAE encoder [ 52 ]to obtain its latent representation zref = E(xref ). To obtain a clean motion signal, this latent is passed through a specific DiT block at a low denoising step, typically t = 0 . For our tile-based approach, we first partition the spatial dimensions into tiles of size (th, t w). For each tile, we select a represen-tative query at the tile center and compute its attention with all keys in the target frame. For any pair of frames (i, j ) in the video, the representative cross-frame attention map Arep

is computed as: 

Arep

is the spatial token length, and τ is the temperature parame-ter. From this representative attention map, we estimate the window center for each tile as:

[s] · pos (s) (2) where pos (s) denotes the spatial position of token s. This estimated center guides the subsequent window-constrained Attention Motion Flow (AMF) computation, enabling effi-cient motion extraction while maintaining spatial precision. 

Sliding-window motion extraction. To enhance the com-putational efficiency and precision of AMF extraction, we propose a novel sliding window strategy that mitigates the redundant computations inherent in prior methods. Our ap-proach leverages the observation that long-range query-key interactions in self-attention layers yield diminished motion information, and the most relevant keys for an object are typically confined to a local spatial window due to finite motion speeds. We extract AMF from query Q and key K, both of shape 

(N, H, W, D ), where H and W denote the height and width of the latent representation, and N is the number of frames. Here, Q = {q1, . . . , q N }, with qi, i ∈ { 1, . . . , N } represent-ing the query tensor for a specific frame, and K follows a similar notation. Unlike prior methods that compute AMF across all q-k pairs while attending to the entire spatial di-mension, our approach employs a sliding window to con-strain computations both temporally and spatially: 

Twindow (qi) = {qj : j ∈ [i, min( i + sf , N )] },

Swindow (kh,w ) = {kh′,w ′ : ( h′, w ′) ∈ W lh,w } (3) where sf represents the temporal span and Wlh,w denotes a spatial window of size l × l centered at position (h, w ).To determine the optimal window center, we partition each frame into spatial blocks and select representative queries. The window center for each block is computed as: 

c(ij )

= Pblock + argmax (h,w )



(4) where Pblock is the block center position and the argmax operation yields the displacement vector from representative query-key interactions. 4❄ 3D  VAE

Figure 4. Overview of our method . Left : Given a reference video, we first leverage the sliding window to extract motion embedding from attention during the inversion stage. At the denoising stage, we calculate the total loss and leverage the step-skipping gradient optimization to guide the video generation. Right: The Step-skipping gradient optimization is proposed to improve gradient redundancy. Additionally, we introduce the corresponding-window loss to boost the motion consistency of generated videos. 

Our approach significantly enhances efficiency. Tempo-rally, it reduces the time complexity from O(F 2) to O(F ),where F is the number of frames, enabling scalable video generation. Spatially, by constraining computations to a local window containing the most relevant keys, we elimi-nate redundant calculations, thereby achieving precise AMF extraction with minimal quality loss. 

3.3. Corresponding-window Loss 

Motivated by the observation that motion information is pre-dominantly captured by closely adjacent query-key pairs, we design a weighted AMF loss and a corresponding-window loss to enhance motion transfer accuracy with temporal sta-bility. The weighted AMF loss aligns the motion patterns between reference and generated videos by computing the 

L2 distance between their respective displacement matrices, which is formulated as: 

LAMF = 1

if d ≤ sf

0 otherwise (6) where α is set as 0.2 to provide linear decay, and d = |j − i|

represents the frame distance. To enhance temporal consistency, we introduce acorresponding-window loss that penalizes inconsistencies in key representations across adjacent frames within the sliding windows:

and comparing with target frame j.The total loss combines both components with appropri-ate weighting: 

Ltotal = λAMF · L AMF + λwindow · L window , (8) where λAMF is set to 5 to emphasize motion alignment, and λtrack is set to 1 to balance the corresponding-window loss. This dual-component loss ensures both accurate motion transfer and temporal stability, effectively addressing motion consistency challenges in video generation. 

3.4. Step-Skipping Gradient Optimization 

Despite the computational efficiency introduced by our slid-ing window strategy, optimizing the latent representation remains computationally intensive due to the high cost of back propagation through multiple DiT blocks. Through empirical analysis, we observe a high degree of similarity in the gradients of the latent representation across consecutive 5Ours Attn i W/o sliding window

Illustration of attention motion flow extraction with sliding window .Without the sliding window, attention tokens are prone to incorrect correspondences (middle). Incorporating a sliding window improves alignment, leading to better motion consistency (right).

optimization steps. Leveraging this insight, we propose an interval-based gradient reuse strategy that selectively com-putes gradients while maintaining optimization effective-ness. Our step-skipping optimization operates with a fixed in-terval ∆ during the inner optimization loop. For a total of J optimization steps, gradient computation occurs only when the current step j satisfies the condition j mod ∆ = 0 ,or when using the full AMF mode. The algorithm can be formalized as: 

Lj =

(

∇xLtotal (xj ) if j mod ∆ = 0 or mode = AMF 

xj · gcached otherwise (9) where gcached represents the gradient from the most recent computation step. This strategy reduces gradient compu-tations from J to approximately ⌈J/ ∆⌉ per guidance step, achieving a theoretical speedup of ∆/⌈J/ ∆⌉× in the opti-mization phase. The cached gradient gcached is updated after each actual gradient computation: 

gcached = gj when j mod ∆ = 0 (10) This approach significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining motion transfer quality, as the gradient similarity across consecutive steps ensures that cached gra-dients remain effective for optimization guidance. 

## 4. Experiments 

4.1. Implementation details 

In our experiment, we employ the open-sourced video gen-eration model WAN-2.1 [ 51 ] as the base text-to-video gen-eration model. The denoising steps are employed for 50 for all experiments. Unless stated, the output resolution is 480 × 832 with F = 81 frames (internally rounded to 

4k+1 ). Latents are initialized as Gaussian noise of shape  1, 16 , F −14 + 1 , H

for the DiT. During motion transfer, as Pondaven et al. [34] , we enable our sliding-window based AMF guid-ance at the first 20% outer denoising steps; each guided step runs a 10-step latent-only inner optimization with AdamW and a linear learning-rate decay 0.003 → 0.002 . At each guided diffusion step t, we form a reference latent by adding step-consistent noise to cached clean latents and perform a forward pass with null text to extract queries/keys from the 15th DiT block. 

Qualitative comparison. We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art video motion transfer methods visu-ally: MOFT [ 63 ], MotionInversion [ 55 ], MotionClone [ 17 ], SMM [ 69 ], MotionDirector [ 85 ], DiTFlow [34 ], and DeT [ 45 ]. For fair comparison, we adapt the Wan-2.1 as the same backbone. Our experimental results demonstrate that FastVMT achieves superior performance and greater versatility across a wide range of motion transfer scenarios. As illustrated in Fig. 9, these works [ 35 , 45 , 63 , 69 ] have the challenge of handling complicated interaction motion. In contrast, our method enables generating videos with aligned movement patterns, preserving the spatial relationships be-tween moving subjects. 

Quantitative comparison. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art video motion transfer on on 50 high-quality videos selected from the DAVIS dataset [ 33 ]. For fair comparison, we employ Wan-2.1 as the same backbone. Previous works are constrained by the limited video length, with evaluations conducted using only 32 frames at a reso-lution of 830 × 480 . In this context, we classify the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods into two categories: training-free and tuning-based, based on whether they leverage spa-tial/temporal LoRA for optimizing complex motion patterns. (a) Time : We record the total time required for completing the motion transfer process, including any inference-time op-timization. Leveraging proposed sliding-window motion ex-traction and step-skipping gradient optimization, FastVMT is the fastest method. Its runtime is faster than training-free methods, while delivering better performance. (b) Motion Fidelity: As in Yatim et al. [69] , we use motion fidelity to assess the similarity of tracklets between reference and generated videos. (c) Temporal Consistency: We measure frame-to-frame coherence by calculating the average feature similarity of consecutive video frames using CLIP [ 42 ]. (d) 

Text Similarity: CLIP is used to extract features from the target video, and the average cosine similarity between the input prompt and video frames is computed. (f) User Study: To account for the limitations of automatic metrics in capturing real-world preferences, we conducted a user study with 20 volunteers. They ranked methods based on motion preservation, appearance diversity, text alignment, and overall quality, using a 1 (best) to 8 (worst) scale.

method outperforms others in both automated metrics and user preferences. In addition, we collect 40 real-world videos and 40 high-quality generated videos by advanced text-to-video genera-tive models [ 16 , 53 ]. For each video, we generate 5 different prompts. Four metrics in VBench [ 13 ] are employed for a more accurate evaluation (in Tab. 1). (1) Subject Consis-tency: We assess whether the identity of the subject is pre-served across frames. (2) Motion Smoothness: The metric evaluates inter-frame continuity using learned motion priors. (3) Aesthetic Quality uses a LAION-trained aesthetic pre-dictor to score visual appeal. (4) Background Consistency: 

We evaluate the coherence of the background. Our proposed method significantly outperforms all baseline approaches across every video quality metric, thereby showcasing the state-of-the-art performance in novel video.

It is clear to observe a light reduction in motion fidelity and temporal consistency, confirming that our approach effectively balances computational efficiency with motion transfer quality. Additionally, we also show the visual comparison of attention motion extraction in various attention layers in DiT (see Fig. 7). The motion extraction is more accurate in the middle layer of DiT. 7Table 1. Comparison with state-of-the-art video motion transfer methods .

Effectiveness of corresponding-window loss. Tab. 2 and Fig. 10 reveal that excluding the corresponding-window loss leads to substantial degradation in motion fidelity, highlight-ing its essential role in maintaining accurate motion transfer. As shown in Fig. 8, equipping with this loss function effec-tively constrains temporal inconsistencies to ensure robust motion alignment, while introducing minimal computational overhead (less than 1% increase in processing time), thus preserving both accuracy and efficiency. 

Effectiveness of step skipping gradient upgrading. The step-skipping strategy significantly reduces computational time while preserving video generation quality. As demon-strated in Tab. 2 and Fig. 10, this optimization achieves substantial time savings with negligible impact on motion fi-delity and temporal consistency, validating the effectiveness of gradient reuse in our framework. 

## 5. Conclusion 

In this work, we introduced FastVMT, a training-free video motion transfer framework that explicitly addresses motion redundancy in diffusion transformer architectures and gradi-ent redundancy along the diffusion trajectory. To eliminate the motion redundancy, we propose the sliding-window strat-egy associated with corresponding window loss to achieve a more reliable and more efficient local search for motion cor-respondence. To migrate gradient redundancy, We introduce a step-skipping gradient computation to ensure computa-tional efficiency. By incorporating the proposed strategies, our method achieves a 3.43 × average speedup without com-promising either visual fidelity or temporal consistency. We believe this line of work opens new opportunities for building more efficient and practical generative video motion transfer. 

## Reproducibility Statement 

All quantitative tables, qualitative images, and video results in this work are reproducible and correspond to raw model outputs without manual editing or post-hoc alteration, except for minimal format conversion and compression. After the review process, we will release a partial public repository to support reproduction, including inference scripts, example data, and example videos. The datasets, configurations, and procedures used for training and evaluation are documented in Section 4.1. We will also provide fixed configuration files and random seeds so that independent runs can reproduce the visual results within expected stochastic variation. 

## Ethics Statement 

Our work studies motion-transfer video editing. The pro-posed dataset contains videos of people, vehicles, and land-scape camera motions. To mitigate representational bias in demonstrations, we curated and display examples span-ning different races, genders, and styles in the main text and appendix.

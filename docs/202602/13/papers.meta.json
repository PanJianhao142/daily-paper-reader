      "abstract_en": "Embodied navigation has long been fragmented by task-specific architectures. We introduce ABot-N0, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model that achieves a ``Grand Unification'' across 5 core tasks: Point-Goal, Object-Goal, Instruction-Following, POI-Goal, and Person-Following. ABot-N0 utilizes a hierarchical ``Brain-Action'' architecture, pairing an LLM-based Cognitive Brain for semantic reasoning with a Flow Matching-based Action Expert for precise, continuous trajectory generation.   To support large-scale learning, we developed the ABot-N0 Data Engine, curating 16.9M expert trajectories and 5.0M reasoning samples across 7,802 high-fidelity 3D scenes (10.7 $\\text{km}^2$). ABot-N0 achieves new SOTA performance across 7 benchmarks, significantly outperforming specialized models. Furthermore, our Agentic Navigation System integrates a planner with hierarchical topological memory, enabling robust, long-horizon missions in dynamic real-world environments.\n\n---"

      "abstract_en": "One of the central challenges in the study of human motor control and learning is the degrees-of-freedom problem. Although the dynamical systems approach (DSA) has provided valuable insights into addressing this issue, its application has largely been confined to cyclic or simplified motor movements. To overcome this limitation, the present study employs neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to model the time evolution of non-cyclic full-body movements as a low-dimensional latent dynamical system. Given the temporal complexity full-body kinematic chains, baseball pitching was selected as a representative target movement to examine whether DSA could be extended to more complex, ecologically valid human movements. Results of the verification experiment demonstrated that the time evolution of a complex pitching motion could be accurately predicted (R^2 > 0.45) using the NODE-based dynamical model. Notably, approximately 50% of the variance in the latter half of the pitching motion was explained using only the initial ~8% of the temporal sequence, underscoring how subsequent movement evolves from initial conditions according to ODE-defined dynamics in latent space. These findings indicate the potential to extend the DSA to more complex and ecologically valid forms of human movement."

      "abstract_en": "Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models, enabling parallel token generation while achieving competitive performance. Despite these advantages, MDMs face a fundamental limitation: once tokens are unmasked, they remain fixed, leading to error accumulation and ultimately degrading sample quality. We address this by proposing a framework that trains a model to perform both unmasking and correction. By reusing outputs from the MDM denoising network as inputs for corrector training, we train a model to recover from potential mistakes. During generation we apply additional corrective refinement steps between unmasking ones in order to change decoded tokens and improve outputs. We name our training and sampling method Progressive Self-Correction (ProSeCo) for its unique ability to iteratively refine an entire sequence, including already generated tokens. We conduct extensive experimental validation across multiple conditional and unconditional tasks, demonstrating that ProSeCo yields better quality-efficiency trade-offs (up to ~2-3x faster sampling) and enables inference-time compute scaling to further increase sample quality beyond standard MDMs (up to ~1.3x improvement on benchmarks)."

      "abstract_en": "Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

      "abstract_en": "Most existing hand motion generation benchmarks for hand-object interaction (HOI) focus on static objects, leaving dynamic scenarios with moving targets and time-critical coordination largely untested. To address this gap, we introduce the DynaHOI-Gym, a unified online closed-loop platform with parameterized motion generators and rollout-based metrics for dynamic capture evaluation. Built on DynaHOI-Gym, we release DynaHOI-10M, a large-scale benchmark with 10M frames and 180K hand capture trajectories, whose target motions are organized into 8 major categories and 22 fine-grained subcategories. We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate."

      "abstract_en": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes. These results highlight FGNO's robustness to data scarcity and its superior capacity to learn expressive representations for diverse time series."

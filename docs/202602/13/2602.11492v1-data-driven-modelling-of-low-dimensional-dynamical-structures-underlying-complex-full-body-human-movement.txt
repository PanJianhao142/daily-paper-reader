One of the central challenges in the study of human motor control and learning is the 

degree s-of -freedom problem. Although the dynamical systems approach (DSA) has 

provided valuable insights into addressing this issue, its application has largely been 

confined to cyclic or simplified motor movements . To overcome this limitation, the 

present study employs neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to model the time 

evolution of non -cyclic full -body movements as a low -dimensional latent dynamical 

system. Given the temporal complexity full -body kinematic chains, baseball pitching was 

selected as a representative target movement to examine whether DSA could be extended 

to more complex, ecologically valid human movements . Results of the verification 

experiment demonstrated that the time evolution of a complex pitching motion could be 

accurately predicted (R² > 0.45) using the NODE -based dynamical model. Notably, 

approximately 50% of the variance in the latter half of the pitching motion was explained 

using only the initial ~8% of the temporal sequence, underscoring how subsequent 

movement evolves from initial conditions according to ODE -defined dynamic s in latent 

space. These findings indicate the potential to extend the DSA to more complex and 

ecologically valid forms of human movement.

One of the central challenges in the study of human motor control and learning is the 

degree s-of -freedom (DoF) problem [1] . Because the human body is a highly redundant 

motor system comprising hundreds of joints, many combinations of joint angles can 

achieve a given movement goal. 

The dynamical systems approach (DSA) conceptualizes complex human 

movement as the time evolution of a low -dimensional dynamical system regulated by 

underlying self -organizing processes [2 -4]. In this framework, collective variables 

summarize the coordination among numerous degrees of freedom, and their temporal 

evolution is described by nonlinear differential equations. This approach has successfully 

explained stability, phase transitions, and coordination phenomena in cyclic movements 

such as bimanual coordination [5] . By focusing on emergent coordination dynamics [6], 

DSA provides insights that purely computational or optimization -based frameworks 

cannot naturally capture [7] .

Nonetheless, a limitation of current DSA studies is the narrow range of target 

movements examined. Specifically, prior research has primarily analyzed coordination 

dynamics in cyclic movements, such as bimanual coordination and gait [5, 8] , or simple 

discrete movements, including reaching [9 -10] . However, real -world human movement 

encompasses a broader spectrum of high -DoF motor behaviours . Although DSA has been 

applied to more complex movements, such as full -body athletic movements in sports 

contexts [11 -14] , these studies have largely focused on coordination dynamics among a 

limited set of variables (e.g., the head or center of mass), rather than deriving a 

mathematical representation of coordination across complex sequences of full -body joint 

movements. Importantly, this limited application may reflect multiple factors, including 

challenges in designing appropriate differential equation structures, and the fact that many 

conventional analytical methods were developed under assumptions of periodicity or 

st ationarity. 

Several studies have explored extending DSA to more complex movements , such 

as full -body athletic tasks . First, even highly complex full -body movements often exhibit 

stereotyped coordination patterns that can be effectively compressed into low -

dimensional representations using dimension -reduction techniques, such as principal 

component analysis (PCA) [15, 16]. Furthermore, in sequential full -body movements, 

inertia is critical, such that motor actions at a given phase depend strongly on the 

preceding phases [17, 18] . Thus, the temporal evolution of these sequential movements may be predictable using differential equations that incorporate such temporal 

dependencies. Moreover , despite the ir biochemical complexity and kinematic redundancy, 

full -body movements often exhibit high reproducibility and robustness to perturbations 

[19 ]. This suggests that underlying stable coordination dynamics can be described within 

a dynamical systems framework. 

Based on these considerations, the limited scope of DSA applications to date is 

likely attributable not to conceptual limitations of the framework itself but rather to 

technical challenges in the mathematical modeling of complex, noncyclic, full -body 

move ments. In this context, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) [20] may 

offer an effective solution to the technical limitations of current DSA approaches. NODEs 

are a neural -network -based mathematical modeling technique that represent the time 

evo lution of features within a latent space, typically constructed using methods such as 

variational autoencoders (VAEs) [21] , via a neural -network -based formulation of 

differential equations. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to capture the 

temporal structure of complex human movements in a low -dimensional latent feature 

space , without relying on periodicity or stationarity assumptions . Previous research has 

demonstrated the effectiveness of NODEs across a range of human motion prediction 

tasks, consistently reporting high performance [22, 23] . Unlike traditional DSA 

implementations that require predefined coordination variables, NODEs learn governing 

differential equations directly from data , enabling the modelling of non -cyclic, full body 

movements as the evolution of low -dimensional dynamical system s in latent space. 

The present study aimed to investigate whether coordination dynamics in non -

cyclic, full -body movements can be modelled and predicted using NODEs . Baseball 

pitching was selected as a representative task . As demonstrated in previous studies [24] ,

one of the most prominent characteristics of baseball pitching is a complex kinematic 

chain that progresses sequentially from the lower limbs to the trunk and upper limbs. If 

this complex movement can be effectively captured as latent dynamics within a l ow -

dimensio nal space, it would suggest that DSA is extensible beyond its conventional 

application domains. The source code used in this study, the anonymized dataset, and 

other supporting materials are publicly available on GitHub 

(https://github.com/takamido/NODE_baseball_pitching ). 

2. Method s

2. 1. NODE model used in this study 2.1.1 Overview 

Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the NODE model used in this study. This model aims 

to predict the temporal evolution of target movement using information from its initial 

state as input. If complex full -body movements can be accurately modeled as the temporal 

evolution of a dynamical system in a low -dimensional latent space, their future evolution 

is predictable with high precision based solely on the initial state. 

During model prediction, the original motion data were first input into the 

encoder (Figure 1a). From this sequence, only the initial portion of the motion (e.g., the 

first 8% of the time series) was used to determine the initial position in the low -

dimensional latent space (Figure 1b). We then generated latent trajectories by integrating 

ODE learned by the neural network (Figure 1c). Finally, the generated trajectory was 

passed to the decoder, which reconstructed the full -body motion based on the predicted 

latent trajectory (Figure 1d). The differential -equation structure was learned in a data -

driven manner , eliminating the need for predefined collective variables. By

parameterizing dynamics with a neural network, the model capture d low -dimensional 

movement structure without assuming periodicity or stationarity , thereby overcom ing key 

limitations of traditional DSA.  The following sections provide the detailed theoretical and 

technical descriptions of each component of the proposed model. 

Figure 1. Overview of the NODE model used in this study for predicting the pitching 

movement. 2.1.2. Transformer encoder for latent space generation 

Here , a transformer module [25] was selected as the encoder to embed human motion 

data into a low -dimensional latent space. This choice was motivated by findings from 

previous research [26] , which suggested that the transformer module is effective for 

encoding and decoding temporal dependencies characteristic of full -body, long sequential 

movements. Because the present study primarily focuses on applying the transformer 

architecture to motion generation, a detailed description of its internal components is 

omitted. Additional details are provided in the original implementation [25]. 

The encoding module receives motion data and maps it to a lower -dimensional 

latent space, producing a latent trajectory represented as a se quence of latent states. 

Theoretically, let input feature  𝒙 0:𝑇 −1 ∈ ℝ𝑇 ×𝐷  denote a time series of the whole -body 

human motion data of length  𝑇 , where  𝐷  is the dimension of motion features per frame 

(e.g., concatenated 3 -dimensional joint positions). The encoder maps the  𝒙 0:𝑇 −1 into a 

sequence of 𝐾 low -dimensional latent variables  𝒛 0:𝐾 −1 ∈ ℝ𝐾 ×𝑑  . Each latent variable 

capture d the movement state at specific time point . Specifically , full -body pitching 

movements were mapped onto 12 trajectory points in a three -dimensional latent space. 

Among these variables, the initial state  𝒛 0 is used to generate the latent trajectory via the 

ODE (Figure 1b and c). During latent -variable generation, a causal mask is applied to 

prevent access to future information. 

2.1.3 ODE for modelling the time evolution of latent states 

From the initial latent state  𝒛 0 obtained from the encoder, the subsequent evolution of 

the system in the latent space is described as a deterministic flow defined using the 

following ODE :

𝑑 𝒛 ̂ (𝑡 )

𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓 𝜃 (𝒛 (𝑡 ), 𝑡 ), (1)

where 𝑓 𝜃  is a neural network (e.g., multilayer perceptron [ MLP ]) that defines a vector 

field on the latent space. As illustrated in Figure 1c, future states are predicted 

deterministically from an initial condition  𝒛 0 by following the flow induced by Eq. (1). 

This deterministic ODE flow captures the high reproducibility and stereotyped structure underlying complex full -body movements. 

In the proposed model, the ODE predicts a latent trajectory with the same length 

as the original time series ( 𝑇 ) from the initial latent state  𝒛 0, yielding  𝒛 ̂1:𝑇 −1 ∈ ℝ𝑇 ×𝑑 .

The predicted trajectory is then passed through a decoder to reconstruct the corresponding 

sequence of motion states in the original feature space. Finally, an MLP decoder 

reconstructs the original motion sequence (Figure 1d). Because the encoder compresses 

full -body motion into a low -dimensional representation, a relatively simple MLP suffices 

for decoding. 

2.1. 4 Design of the loss function 

Following the standard VAE formulation, the model was trained end -to -end by 

minimizing the following loss function: 

ℒ = 𝜆 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 + 𝜆 𝑘𝑙 ℒ𝑘𝑙 , (2)

where  ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛  denotes the reconstruction loss weighted by the hyperparameter  𝜆 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 

for the original motion sequence.  ℒ𝑘𝑙  is the Kullback -Leibler divergence loss weighted 

by the  𝜆 𝑘𝑙  that regularizes the latent -variable posterior toward a standard normal prior 

[27] . By penalizing the reconstruction error and the posterior distribution shape, the latent 

space is encouraged to exhibit a smooth and continuous structure, which facilitates the 

definition of a well -behaved dynamical flow in the latent space. 

2.2 Dataset 

The applicability of the NODE model described in the previous section was evaluated 

using baseball pitching data as a representative noncyclic, full -body movement. The 

dataset comprised measurements from eight collegiate -league pitchers (174.1 ± 4.1 cm, 

74 .91 ± 3.8 kg, 19.87 ± 1.0 years). All pitchers had more than 10 years of playing 

experience. Previously collected data were used in this study. An opt -out informed 

consent framework was adopted in accordance with the university’s ethical guidelines. 

Inform ation regarding the study, including its purpose and usage, was made publicly 

available to enhance transparency. Individuals whose data were included were pro vi ded 

a clear opportunity to decline participation. For dataset collection, each pitcher’s motion was recorded at a sampling rate of 

200 Hz using 16 synchronized optical motion -capture cameras (Raptor -E and Kestrel 

2200, Motion Analysis Corp., Santa Rosa, USA). To simulate realistic game -like 

conditions, p itchers threw diverse pitch types to random target locations. All pitches were 

delivered using a wind -up motion characterized by a large leg lift. From the captured data, 

the positions of 15 joints were extracted as follows: the parietal region (head), bil ateral 

acromions (shoulders), lateral epicondyles of the humerus (elbows), radial styloid 

processes (wrists), greater trochanters of the femur (hips), lateral femoral condyles 

(knees), and both heels and toes (tops of the shoes). 

Based on the measured joint position data, the analysis window for each pitch 

was determined using the following procedure. For each pitch, the time at which the 

pitcher’s leading knee reached its maximum height was identified. Subsequently, by 

tracing ba ckward in time from this point, the earliest frame at which the knee’s vertical 

upward velocity dropped below 5% of its maximum value was selected as the onset of 

motion (i.e., initial time frame). Next, the time point of maximum right -wrist velocity was 

detected and defined as ball release. Using the trial in which ball release occurred latest 

as a temporal reference, the motion sequences for all trials were temporally aligned and 

extracted accordingly. Consequently, time -series data representing the time evolution of 

the pitching motion, comprising 45 -dimensional features (15 joints × 3D positions), were 

obtained. 

In conventional biomechanical studies, the time between motion onset and ball 

release is typically normalized to a fixed scale (e.g., 0 –100%) for analysis (e.g., [28] ). 

Unlike many dynamical systems studies, in t his study, we did not apply temporal 

normalization , preserv ing the natural temporal structure of the movement. This allowed 

the latent dynamics to be modelled in real physical time, rather than in an artificially 

rescaled phase representation. Consequently, some trials included a follow -through phase 

beyond ball release, whereas others terminated precisely at ball release. This results in a 

substantial increase in inter -trial variability during the latter portion of the motion 

sequence, which ma kes the prediction task more challenging. Therefore, this dataset 

provides a meaningful opportunity to investigate whether NODEs can be used to model 

trial -to -trial variability in individual -specific dynamical structure . For reference, a video 

that overlay s all pitching motions from all pitchers has been uploaded to the GitHub 

repository as supporting information. Through the above data generation process, eight 

individual datasets were constructed, one per pitcher, as summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Participants’ information for the analysis

2.3 Experiment 

Based on the developed dataset, a NODE model was trained to capture the dynamics of 

the pitching motion, and its ability to predict temporal evolution was evaluated. During 

training, the transformer encoder architecture used transformer modules with three layers, 

eight attention heads per layer, and a model dimension of 256. The latent -space 

dimensionality was set to  𝑑 = 3 , thereby reducing the original motion data with 

dimension  𝐷 = 45  to a lower -dimensional representation. The entire motion sequence 

was modeled using three latent features. The number of time -series points mapped onto 

the latent space by the transformer encoder was set as  𝐾 = 12 . Consequently, the initial 

latent state  𝒛 0 encodes approximately the first 8% of the original motion sequence and 

serves as the initial condition of the dynamical system governing the subsequent evolution. 

In the prediction task, the model forecasts the remaining 92% of the motion using only 

the initial information. The latent dynamics  𝑓 𝜃  (i.e., the vector field) was modeled using 

a three -layer MLP with two hidden layers, each consisting of 128 units and tanh activation 

functions. The MLP decoder comprised three fully connected layers, with two hidden 

layers of 256 units and ReLU activatio ns, followed by a linear output layer producing 45 -

dimensional joint positions. 

Training was performed using 10 -fold cross -validation for each pitcher dataset. 

In each fold, nine subsets were used for training and one subset was used for testing. 

Motion features were standardized using the mean and standard deviation calculated from 

the training set. The weights for each penalty term in the loss function were set as  𝜆 𝑘𝑙 =1 × 10 −3 and  𝜆 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛 = 1.0. The batch size was set to 32. With these hyperparameter 

settings, the model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 

1 × 10 −4. The model was trained for 1500 epochs. Training was conducted on the Google 

Colab platform using an NVIDIA T4 GPU. 

To evaluate the prediction performance of the trained model, the following 

metrics were computed. First, reconstruction errors for the test motions were quantified 

using the root mean squared error (RMSE) at each predicted time frame and were 

aggregated f or each joint across all pitchers and cross -validation folds. To ensure 

reproducibility, the latent variables were deterministically derived at test time using the 

mean of the encoded latent distribution. For comparison, RMSE was computed for a 

baseline mo del that predicted each frame using the mean of the training data. To evaluate 

whether the learned dynamical flow constrains the evolution of the movement beyond 

statistical baselines, the time -resolved coefficient of determination,  𝑅 2(𝑡 ) was 

computed using the following equation: 

𝑅 2(𝑡 ) = 1 − 𝑆𝑆 𝑟𝑒𝑠 (𝑡 )

𝑆𝑆 𝑜𝑟𝑖 (𝑡 ) , (3)

where  𝑆𝑆 𝑜𝑟𝑖 (𝑡 ) is the total sum of squares of the original data at each time frame, and 

𝑆𝑆 𝑟𝑒𝑠 (𝑡 ) is the residual sum of squares between the original data and the model 

predictions. To evaluate prediction accuracy, particularly in the latter phase of motion 

where variability was often greater, both the mean R² value across the entire time series 

and the mean R² value across the latter 50% were calculated for each individual. 

3. Results 

Figure 2 displays the RMSE values at each time point for each participant. Baseline 

prediction s based on the training -data mean exhibited a pronounced increase in error 

during the later phase of the motion (Figure 2). In contrast the NODE -based prediction 

mitigated this error growth, suggesting that the learned latent dynamics shape the later 

temporal evolution of the movement (Figure 2) . Across all pitchers and the entire 

prediction interval, the mean RMSE was 66.1 ± 15.7 mm. Figure 3 presents the  𝑅 2

values for each participant at each timepoint. In Figure 3, the NODE -based prediction, 

conditioned only on approximately 8% of the initial motion, substantially reduced uncertainty in the subsequent time evolution of the full -body pitching movement ,

indicating that the learned latent dynamics constrained the trajectory beyond what would 

be expected from trial -averaged behaviour . The mean  𝑅 2 across all pitchers over the 

entire motion was 0.46 ± 0.20, and the mean  𝑅 2 computed for the second half of the 

motion was 0.49 ± 0.20. Figure 4 displays a comparison of the original and reconstructed 

motions for all pitching trials for each participant . The NODE model captures trial -to -

trial variability in the subsequent evolution of the motion based on subtle differences in 

the preparatory phase, consistent with sensitivity to initial latent states (Figure 4) . Finally, 

Figure 5 presents an example of the learned latent trajectories and the corresponding 

motions generated from the model. The temporal evolution of the pitching movement is 

largely captured by a three -dimensional latent dynamical system (Figure 5) .

The high predictive performance of the NODE model demonstrates that the evolution of 

full -body pitching movements follows a three -dimensional dynamical system in latent 

space. Although the pitching movement can seem complex, the dynamics of its time 

evolution can be effectively captured by a three -dimensional flow in the latent space. 

Therefore, modeling the pitching motion —a representative example of a noncyclic, high -

DoF, full -body movement —using NODE in this study demonstrated the potential to 

expand the applicability of DSA. 

It is worth considering why the NODE model achieved high prediction accuracy. 

First, movement analysis was performed by trained athletes, whose motor patterns are 

highly stereotyped and stable through deliberate practice [29 ]. Previous studies have 

suggested that repeated practice can reorganize coordination and, in some task contexts, 

reduce the effective dimensionality of movement, leading to the emergence of more stable 

low -dimensional dynamical structures [30] . Regarding DSA, such pattern formation 

enhances stability against perturbations [31] ; thus, experienced pitchers, who must meet 

high demands for accuracy and reproducibility, may have adapted to these task constraints 

[32 ] by developing more stabilized dynamical structu res. Accordingly , the model may 

have greater difficulty predicting movements in novice individuals, whose movement 

patterns tend to be less stable [33] .

Nonetheless, some movement characteristics were not captured by the model 

developed in this study. The key limitation is movement variability reduction . The 

generated motions appeared more stereotyped, often translating similar postural patterns 

or shifting phases (Figure 4) . Therefore, the remaining 50% of the motion variance may 

be attributed to fluctuations that are not incorporated into the present model. From a DSA 

perspective, fluctuations are not merely random noise but reflect the stability propert ies 

of the underlying coordination dynamics [34 ]. While the present deterministic latent 

dynamical model captures the dominant low -dimensional flow underlying the full -body 

movement, it does not explicitly model the fluctuation dynamics around this structure. 

From a practical perspective, the tendency of the model to generate more 

stereotyped movements may be interpreted as a lack of functional variability in the 

generated motion. Functional variability refers to structured, task -relevant variations in 

movement that allow flexibility and adaptability while maintaining overall performance 

stability [35] . Because f unctional variability plays a key role in the adaptive moto r control 

of high DoF human movement , representing such fluctuations in mathematical models would constitute a fundamental issue. Although stochastic fluctuations can be introduced 

into the generated movements through approaches such as extensions to stochastic 

differential equations [36] , more sophisticated models are necessary to capture the 

functional covariance structures embedded in human movement. 

It is important to clarify how the present ed approach differs from standard 

dynamical systems modelling frameworks, such as the HKB model [5] . Standard DSA 

studies identify parameters (e.g., relative phase between both hands ) and demonstrate 

their stability using systematic manipulation of control variables (e.g., oscillation 

frequency ), thereby revealing phenomena such as phase transitions and metastability [34] .

In contrast, the present NODE -based model infers a low -dimensional latent dynamical 

structure without explicitly defining order or control parameters. This demonstra tes 

canonical DSA phenomena such as phase transitions or metastability, but in providing 

empirical evidence that is ecologically valid, high -DoF full -body movements admit a 

substantial low -dimensional dynamical structure. In this sense, the work may be viewed 

as a data -driven extension that complements, rather than replaces, standard order -

para meter -based DSA modelling .

Finally, this study has some limitations and directions for future work. First, in 

accordance with the traditional DSA framework, it would be necessary to systematically 

and continuously manipulate control parameters , such as environmental constraints (e.g., 

pitching distance) , and examine whether the latent variables exhibit phase transitions or 

hysteresis [34] . Furthermore, to better interpret the meaning of the identified latent 

variables, we must mathematically analyze learned latent space by the NODE [37] would 

be informative. Finally, from a practical perspective, comparing the NODE model 

prediction accuracy between experts and novices would be useful for understanding the 

roles of stereotypicality and functional variability in motor learning. 

5. Conclusion 

In conclusion, the high predictive performance of the NODE model suggests that complex, 

non -cyclic full -body movements can be described within a low -dimensional dynamical 

systems framework. Notably, approximately 50% of the variance in the latter half of t he 

pitching motion was explained using only the initial ~8% of the movement sequence . This 

underscor es the extent to movem ent evolves from its initial state according to the ODE -

defined dynamical flow in latent space. These findings indicate the potential to extend the 

DSA to more complex and ecologically valid forms of human movement. Incorporating noise and structured functional variability in future models may enable more faithful 

reproduction of the rich dynamics inherent in complex full -body actions. Furthermore, 

systematic manipulation of control parameters and observation of stability changes i n

identified parameters would facilitate rigorous validation within the formal DSA 

framework.

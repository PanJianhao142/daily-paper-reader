# Abstract 

We introduce PerpetualWonder, a hybrid generative sim-ulator that enables long-horizon, action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. Current works fail at this task because their physical state is decoupled from their visual representation, which prevents generative re-finements to update the underlying physics for subsequent interactions. PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel uni-fied representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing genera-tive refinements to correct both the dynamics and appear-ance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve op-timization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency.

# 1. Introduction 

Recent years have seen remarkable progress in genera-tive models for text, images, and videos. This rapid ad-vancement motivates the creation of generative world mod-els [4, 15, 39], which are crucial for applications in VR/AR, gaming, and embodied AI [30]. A key capability for such models is not just to generate realistic content, but to simu-late a world that responds to user actions. We study the task of action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image . Given a single input image and a sequence of phys-ical actions (local forces like pushes and pokes, or global forces like wind fields and gravity), the goal is to generate the dynamic 4D scene that corresponds to the actions and evolves plausibly over time. Early attempts to generate 4D content in response to ac-tions relied heavily on traditional physical simulation [6, 14, 48, 58]. These methods, while offering precise and inter-pretable physical control, are driven entirely by the tradi-tional simulator for both dynamics and appearance. This of-ten results in a significant realism gap, as simplified physics and analytic rendering struggle to capture the complex vi-1

sual phenomena of the real world, such as subtle material deformations, lighting changes, and secondary visual ef-fects like splashes. Concurrently, modern video genera-tion models [4, 44] have become incredibly powerful, learn-ing strong priors about real-world dynamics and appearance from massive video data. This presents a new opportunity, leading to the rise of the 

hybrid generative simulator [21, 38]: a system that first uses the traditional physical simulation to generate coarse, action-conditioned dynamics, and then employs a video generation model as a neural refiner to achieve high-fidelity visual realism. The hybrid generative simulator aims for the best of both worlds, combining the strengths of traditional physical simulators, including consistency and controllabil-ity, with the power of video generation models, which pro-vide visual realism and complex dynamics. Recent WonderPlay [21] is a realization of this hybrid generative simulator concept. However, its approach is fun-damentally limited to short-term interactions within a single time window. The core problem is that the flow of infor-mation is incomplete: the physical state informs the video model, but the video model’s refinement only propagates back to the scene’s appearance representation, not its under-lying physical state. The physical and visual representations are thus decoupled. This prevents any form of long-horizon, sequential interaction, as the physical simulator is blind to the generative corrections from the previous step, leading to the accumulation of errors. We aim to overcome this fundamental limitation and en-able long-horizon, sequential actions. This requires a sys-tem that can perpetually cycle between user actions, physi-cal simulation, and generative refinement. We identify two fundamental challenges: the first is that current physical states (physics particle position and velocity) cannot be up-dated by the refinement from the video generation model. A new representation is required to unify the physical and visual domains. Then, to update the unified representation, the refinement from video generation models must be multi-view to prevent ambiguity in optimization. However, the video models naturally will not generate perfectly consis-tent videos from different viewpoints. To resolve this ambi-guity, a robust update mechanism is required. To address these challenges, we propose PerpetualWon-der , a new hybrid generative simulator for long-horizon action-conditioned 4D scene generation, as shown in Fig-ure 1. First, we introduce visual-physical aligned parti-cle (VPP), a novel unified representation that tightly binds physics particles to the visual representations. The pro-posed VPP acts as a bidirectional bridge: enabling the for-ward physics pass that uses physical simulation to drive the visual prediction, and critically, updating the physics parti-cles through the optimized visual representation in a back-ward optimization, resulting in an innovative closed-loop system. Next, we propose a multi-view optimization mech-anism to ensure the update is 3D consistent and plausible. We first initialize a complete 3D scene from the input image using dense view generation. This initialization allows us to render the scene from arbitrary viewpoints in a wide range and use the video model to gather supervision from multiple views. Then we progressively leverage refined videos from multiple viewpoints for backward optimization. This strat-egy resolves ambiguity, producing a 4D scene that is both visually realistic and physically coherent, ready for the next user action. In summary, our contributions are: • We tackle the task of long-horizon action-conditioned 4D scene generation, enabling sequential action interactions. • We propose PerpetualWonder, a novel hybrid generative simulator that features a unified representation for both physical state and visual appearance, and a multi-view optimization mechanism for consistent scene updates. • We demonstrate that PerpetualWonder consistently out-performs prior work in action-conditioned 4D scene gen-eration, including both long-horizon interaction abilities and scene consistency. 

# 2. Related Work 

Dynamic 4D scene generation. Our work generates action-conditioned 4D scenes and connects to a rich body of research on dynamic scene representation and genera-tion. Early work in this domain focused on reconstruct-ing dynamic scenes from real-world captures. Represen-tations rapidly evolved from dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [23, 27–29] to dynamic Gaussian Splat-ting [18, 45, 49, 51]. While these methods achieve high-fidelity rendering of complex motion, they are fundamen-tally limited to replaying pre-captured events and do not support user actions or the simulation of novel dynamics. More recently, a dominant line of research has focused on generative models for synthesizing novel 4D content. Many of these approaches distill the powerful priors from large-scale video models to generate 4D animations from text or image prompts [1, 2, 9, 22, 32, 37, 56]. These meth-ods leverage dynamic 3D representations to create tem-porally consistent animations. Other works focus on di-rectly modeling the 4D space-time volume [43, 46, 60] or parameterizing 4D representations with generative net-works [33, 57]. However these approaches share a critical limitation: the synthesized dynamics are passive. They gen-erate pre-determined animations and lack the mechanisms to simulate diverse, physically plausible responses to user input actions, which is the core focus of our work. 

Physics-grounded scene generation. To enable action-conditioned interactions, a separate line of work has focused on integrating physical principles [20] and traditional phys-ical simulation methods into the scene generation process. 2Image I

Figure 2. Overview of PerpetualWonder . Given an input image, based on the visual-physical aligned particle, we reconstruct a 3D scene from synthesized dense views. Then we iterate between a forward physics pass and a backward neural optimization. The forward pass leverages physical simulation to generate coarse scene dynamics. Then the backward optimization updates the scene according to the multi-view refined videos from the video generation model. The closed-loop system enables long-horizon actions for the final 4D scene generation. The rendered results on the right showcase the generated scene from each consecutive action. 

Early methods relied entirely on traditional physical simu-lation [6, 14, 48, 58], which provides precise, interpretable control but suffers from a significant realism gap. These simulators often use simplified, approximated physics and rendering with fixed visual appearance, struggling to cap-ture the visual phenomena of the real world, such as subtle material deformations and secondary visual effects. To bridge this realism gap, recent works have begun to integrate physics with the strong priors of generative mod-els. This has culminated in the hybrid generative simula-tor [21, 38] approaches, which aim to blend the control-lability of the physical simulators with the visual realism of the video generation models. The most relevant work, WonderPlay [21], first uses the physics solvers to gener-ate coarse, action-conditioned dynamics and then employs a video model as a neural refiner to achieve high-fidelity vi-sual realism. However, these methods are limited by a fun-damental architectural drawback that the flow of informa-tion is incomplete. The generative refinements, whether for appearance or dynamics, only affect the visual primitives and do not propagate back to the underlying physical state. Furthermore, this makes these methods fundamentally lim-ited to short-term interactions, and are unable to support the long-horizon actions that our work aims to solve. 

Controllable video generation. Concurrently, video gen-eration models have become incredibly powerful [4, 13, 40, 44, 50, 62], achieving stunning realism, but controlling their output remains a significant challenge. Most existing con-trol methods focus on non-physical aspects, such as fol-lowing text instructions, camera trajectories [3, 34, 41, 63], or 2D motion guidance through keypoints and trajecto-ries [7, 10, 26, 36, 47, 59]. While some works explore conditioning on 2D force vectors [11] to mimic the real-world actions, these models lack an explicit underlying 3D representation. These 2D-centric video approaches are in-sufficient for our task, as they cannot ensure physically ac-curate action conditions within a 3D scene or guarantee 3D consistency when rendering the resulting 4D scenes from novel viewpoints. In contrast, our method operates on a full 3D representation, providing the structure for both precise physical interaction and consistent multi-view rendering.

including the global force 

f (x, y, z, t ) (e.g., gravity, wind field) and/or the local force 

f (t), our proposed PerpetualWonder outputs a dynamic 4D scene sequence {S t}Tt=0 . At any time t, the scene state 

St = ( Bt, Ft) is decomposed into the background Bt and the dynamic, interactable foreground Ft.As illustrated in Figure 2, PerpetualWonder achieves this by an innovative closed-loop hybrid generative simulator, perpetually iterating between a forward physics pass Φp and a backward neural optimization pass Ψn. To enable this, we must solve the two fundamental challenges: first, craft-ing a unified representation that allows the physical state to be updated by generative refinements from video models; and second, developing a robust and consistent optimization mechanism to perform these updates without ambiguity. Accordingly, we first introduce the proposed visual-physical aligned particle (VPP) as a unified representa-tion (Section 3.1). We then detail our multi-view optimiza-tion mechanism 3.2, which leverages a single image-based dense 3D reconstruction to perform a progressive, multi-view backward optimization. Finally, we assemble these components into the complete PerpetualWonder simulation loop for long-horizon actions (Section 3.3). 

3.1. Visual-Physical Aligned Particle 

The core of long-horizon action interactions lies in the un-derlying representation. Previous hybrid generative simu-3lators use decoupled visual primitives (e.g., gaussian splat-ting [18]) for appearance and physics particles for dynam-ics. The incomplete binding uses physics particles to drive visual primitives, making it impossible for visual refine-ments from the video generation model to correct the un-derlying dynamics. This prevents a closed-loop system and makes long-horizon simulation inapplicable. To solve this, we introduce the VPP, a novel unified rep-resentation that tightly binds the physics particles to the vi-sual primitives, creating a bidirectional bridge between dy-namics and appearance. We define the foreground Ft as a set of O objects, 

Ft = {P ot , Vot , Got }Oo=1 . For simplicity, here we omit the object index o and time index t. The VPP for a single ob-ject consists of: Physics dynamics. A set of J physics particle positions P =

{pj }Jj=1 and their velocities V = {vj }Jj=1 . The particles P

are sampled from an initial object mesh volume. We detail the process for obtaining the object mesh in the following 3D scene initialization subsection. Visual appearance. A set of J × K visual primitives, i.e., gaussians [18], G = SJj=1 {gj,k }Kk=1 . Specifically, each physics particle pj serves as an anchor to a small set of K

gaussian primitives. The key to the VPP is how these K gaussians are param-eterized relative to their anchor particle pj , enabling both adherence to physics and optimization of appearance and dynamics. We define the attributes of these gaussians with the following details: • Position offset ˜p: Each gaussian’s 3D position μj,k is de-fined by a small, learnable position offset ˜pj,k from its corresponding physics particle pj :

μj,k = pj + tanh(˜ pj,k ) · δ, (1) where δ is the physics particle size defined during the sim-ulator’s sampling process. • Scale : Each gaussian primitive is defined to be isotropic, with a fixed scaling value not larger than δ.• Spatial opacity os and temporal opacity ot(t): Inspired by [42], we define two opacity parameters. os is the standard learnable spatial opacity scalar [18]. ot(t) is a learnable temporal opacity, parameterized by a center time μt and duration sd:

ot(t) = exp − 12 ×

 t − μt

sd

2!

. (2) The final opacity is o(t) = os × ot(t).Rotation and color attributes are parameterized the same as in the original 3D Gaussian Splatting work [18]. This VPP representation forms the foundation of our closed-loop system. By ensuring every physics particle pj has a corre-sponding set of visual primitives {gj,k }, all dynamics and appearance are now expressed by the optimizable visual primitives. This structure creates the bidirectional bridge, where the forward physics pass drives the dynamics by up-dating pj , which in turn moves all anchored visual primi-tives. Critically, the backward optimization pass can now refine the final 4D scene by optimizing the attributes of 

{gj,k } while being constrained to remain consistent with the anchoring physics particles. 

3.2. Multi-View Optimization 

The proposed VPP serves as a representation that can be updated for both 4D scene dynamics and appearance. The remaining challenge lies in how to consistently perform this update. Simply optimizing from a single-view video refine-ment, as done in WonderPlay [21], leads to significant am-biguity and artifacts from novel viewpoints. To tackle this, we introduce a robust multi-view optimization mechanism. This mechanism consists of two components. First, we ini-tialize the complete 3D scene from the single input image to enable rendering from arbitrary viewpoints. Second, we leverage this 3D scene to perform a progressive optimiza-tion using supervision gathered from multiple views. 

3D scene initialization. As the initialization for our hy-brid generative simulator, we first reconstruct the 3D scene 

S0 from the single input image I. To construct a 3D scene that supports rendering from arbitrary viewpoints, we employ a state-of-the-art camera-controlled video model GEN3C [34] to synthesize dense surrounding views of the scene from the input image. This video is then processed with COLMAP [35] to acquire a scene point cloud for ini-tializing 3D Gaussians. Following standard 3DGS optimization [18], we obtain the set of N gaussian primitives {Gi}Ni=1 as the initial scene representation. Each gaussian Gi is parameterized by posi-tion pi, orientation qi, scale si, opacity oi, and color ci.To decompose the scene into background and fore-ground objects, inspired by Gaussian Grouping [52], we add a learnable feature gi to each primitive. We leverage SAM2 [31] to obtain object masks on the dense surround-ing views, which supervise these learnable features. Af-ter decomposition, the Gaussian primitives are split into a background set B0 and sets for each foreground object. These foreground object gaussians are then transformed into closed-surface meshes using TSDFusion [55]. Then these meshes are used to sample the initial physics parti-cles P0 for the proposed VPP. This is followed by another round of optimization for the gaussian primitives {G o 

> 0

}Oo=1 ,with respect to the frames from GEN3C [34], and replace the original foreground objects’ gaussians. This approach contrasts with the scene initializa-tion in WonderPlay, which relies on single-view depth-4unprojection [53, 54] and object placement. Our multi-view reconstruction process builds the background and all objects together in a single, unified 3D coordinate space, which is essential for rendering from dense, arbitrary viewpoints. 

Progressive multi-view optimization. The refinement pro-cess Ψn leverages pre-trained video generation models to refine both appearance and dynamics of the underlying 4D scene. The bridge between our VPP representation and the video generation model is the rendered video. Following [21], the coarse 4D scene from physical simulation (detailed in Section 3.3) is rendered into RGB and optical flow frames from a chosen viewpoint. This coarse video is then refined by the video generation model [5, 50] through a bimodal control scheme, resulting in a refined video Vt.However, refined videos from different viewpoints are inevitably inconsistent and can not be directly used for op-timization. To resolve the ambiguity and acquire the desired 4D scene, we introduce a two-part solution. First, we design a loss function that, combined with our VPP representation, provides a strong consistency prior. For a given time step t, the overall loss function is: 

L = Lp(Render (Bt) ⊙ (1 − M), Vt ⊙ (1 − M)) + Lp(Render (Gt), Vt ⊙ M ) + λsim Lsim . (3) Here, M is the binary mask for the foreground VPPs, 

Render (·) is the gaussian rendering function, and Lp is the photometric loss (L1 and SSIM). In practice, we also model the background gaussians Bt with learnable spatial and temporal opacity (Eq. 2) and other attributes (excluding position) to capture secondary visual effects like shadows. For the foreground VPP Gt, we introduce a simulation con-sistency loss term Lsim :

Lsim = 1

> t=1

(4) The Lsim penalizes the visual primitives μj,k,t for de-viating from their corresponding physics particle pj,t . The VPP representation and the simulation consistency loss act as a strong regularizer, ensuring the optimized visual prim-itives do not break apart from their physical anchors, which inherently mitigates inconsistency. Second, to resolve the remaining visual ambiguity from conflicting refinements in a multi-view setting, we intro-duce a progressive optimization strategy. To leverage in-consistent multi-view videos without introducing artifacts, we first render and refine the video only from the input im-age’s viewpoint and optimize the scene representation with respect to this single video. Then, we render the 4D scene from other viewpoints and use the video model to refine them with a smaller control weight. Finally, we leverage all refined videos from every viewpoint to optimize the scene representation again, yielding a consistent 4D scene. 

3.3. Simulation Loop 

With the proposed novel VPP representation and multi-view optimization mechanism now defined, we can assemble the PerpetualWonder simulation loop. This loop operates over a time window of T steps and consists of three key stages: a forward pass to generate the entire sequence, a backward optimization pass to refine it, and a loop closure that enables the next round of action-conditioned interaction. 

Forward pass. The loop begins with the forward physics pass Φp. Given the scene state S0, the hybrid generative simulator computes the coarse 4D scene for the time win-dow of T steps. This is achieved by applying the physics op-erator Φp step-by-step for each user action At from t = 0 to 

T − 1: ˆSt+1 = Φ p( ˆSt, At). This process generates a coarse sequence { ˆSt}Tt=0 . We adopt a set of solvers [17, 21, 24, 25] for various materials, including cloth, sand, snow, liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies. We refer the reader to Li et al. [21] for more details of the physical simulation pro-cess. As aforementioned, this forward pass provides con-trollable dynamics in response to actions but lacks visual realism and may contain physical inaccuracies. 

Backward optimization. The coarse sequence { ˆSt}Tt=0 is then fed into the refinement process Ψn. As introduced in Section 3.2, we apply our progressive multi-view optimiza-tion to the coarse 4D scene. This step leverages video model priors to correct the appearance and dynamics across all T

steps, resulting in the final refined sequence {S t}Tt=0 .

Loop closure and long-horizon actions. The final step closes the loop and enables perpetual interaction, i.e., per-forming a new round of actions for the following time win-dow. The final refined state of the current time window, ST ,becomes the starting state S0 for the next T -step simulation. To prepare the system for this new time window, we update the VPP’s underlying physics particles using the results of the backward pass. Specifically, we average the positions of the optimized visual primitives {gj,k } at time T to up-date the position pj of their corresponding physics particle. The velocity is directly inherited from the original veloci-ties at time T , which is applicable because Lsim limits the position updates of physics particles in a small range. This corrected physics state {P T , VT } becomes the input for the next forward pass sequence, allowing the system to simulate sequential interactions over a long horizon.

experimental results typically demonstrate multi-step inter-actions across 3 time windows, with each window spanning 392 physical simulation steps and receiving different input actions. For refinement, the video generation model [5] is conditioned on RGB and optical flow renderings at the reso-lution of H=704 , W =1280 from the coarse dynamics. The output videos consist of 49 frames, each frame is sampled from every 8 physical simulation steps. The progressive multi-view optimization mechanism uses 3 key views for supervision: the frontal, left-side, and right-side views. 

Baselines. We compare PerpetualWonder against two main categories of state-of-the-art methods: conditional video generation models and hybrid generative simula-tors. For conditional video generators, we evaluate against Wan2.2 [40], Wan2.6, Veo3.1 [44], Tora [59], DaS [12] and GEN3C [34]. For I2V video generators, both the action

and camera trajectory are specified via text prompts. For GEN3C, we leverage its native camera control capabilities and embed the desired action within the text prompt. For trajectory-based video models like Tora, the dynamics from physical solvers are utilized to drive the generation. For the hybrid generative simulator, we compare against the most relevant prior work, WonderPlay [21]. To ensure a fair com-parison focused on the core simulation loop and represen-tation, we also create a stronger baseline, WonderPlay ++ .This baseline uses our superior multi-view 3D reconstruc-tion for initialization, which provides a more 3D-consistent scene but retains WonderPlay’s original decoupled repre-sentation and single-view optimization methodology. 

Metrics. Our evaluation is performed on a curated dataset of 10 scenes that feature a diverse range of materials, in-cluding cloth, rigid bodies, elastic objects, liquids, gases, 6“A boat moves forward on Lake Venice ” “Jam drips from a tilted jam jar onto toast.”

For ease of comparison, only one time window is shown. The images from left to right illustrate the resulting scene dynamics and camera motion for each method.

and granular substances. We assess two primary aspects: the quality of the generated 4D scene and the plausibil-ity of the physical dynamics. To assess the scene qual-ity, we render all generated scenes along a predefined cam-era trajectory and evaluate them using metrics from World-Score [8]. Specifically, we use rule-based metrics to vali-date camera controllability and 3D consistency. We also in-clude the imaging metric to assess general per-frame visual quality. To evaluate the plausible physical dynamics, we conducted a user study with 350 participants for this aspect. We employed a Two-alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) pro-tocol, asking each participant to evaluate 10 scenes. For each scene, participants were given a multi-step interaction description and viewed a side-by-side, randomly ordered video comparison of our method and a baseline. Partic-ipants selected the video that performed better on one of two criteria: physics plausibility (the correctness of the pre-dicted motion in response to the action) and motion fidelity (the quality and naturalness of the generated motion). 

4.1. Results 

Qualitative comparison to baselines. Figure 4 presents a side-by-side qualitative comparison of our method against some representative baselines. As illustrated, the condi-tional video generation models fail to support both inter-action and arbitrary view changes. Wan2.2 [40] generates plausible motion but disregards camera change instructions provided in the text prompt, causing the camera to remain almost fixed in both scenes. Conversely, GEN3C [34] is 3D-aware and adheres well to camera trajectories, but the object of interest remains static and completely unaffected by the action described in the text prompt. The hybrid generative simulator WonderPlay [21] successfully applies the user ac-tions, but its reliance on single-view optimization leads to severe visual artifacts and geometric inconsistencies when the scene is rendered from novel viewpoints. In contrast, PerpetualWonder generates the complete and consistent 4D scene that both correctly responds to the action inputs and naturally supports rendering from arbitrary viewpoints. 

Quantitative results. The quantitative results in Table 1 show PerpetualWonder’s significant advantages over both conditional video generators and the hybrid simulator. Per-petualWonder achieves best performance in camera control-lability and 3D consistency, while keeping a high level of imaging quality. The user study result is shown in Table 2. In compari-son to all baselines, about 70% to 90% of the participants prefer PerpetualWonder (ours) across both aspects. This strong preference provides strong evidence that Perpetual-Wonder successfully generates plausible physical dynam-ics, enabling long-horizon simulations by preventing the ac-cumulated errors that degrade realism in baseline methods. 

Long-horizon actions. A significant advantage of Perpet-ualWonder is its ability to handle sequential, long-horizon action inputs within a single scene. We compare with Won-derPlay [21] and demonstrate this capability in Figure 5 and also Figure 1. WonderPlay exhibits severe accumulated errors as the interactions progress. For instance, after the 7Input Image Time

shovel is rotated in the air, it fails to maintain its shape in-tegrity and becomes unrealistically deformed upon insertion into the castle. This is a fundamental limitation of its de-sign: the generative refinements from the last time window do not propagate back to update the physical particles in simulators for the next round of interaction. As a result, at the initialization of each new round, the gaussian primitives are reset to their original positions rather than the optimized positions according to the refined video. The discrepancy causes severe fracturing artifacts and disrupts the temporal continuity across time windows. The decoupling, combined with the reliance on single-view refinement, results in visual artifacts and unstable dynamics as errors compound. In contrast, our VPP representation provides a bidirec-tional bridge, allowing the refined state ST from the end of one round to become the corrected initial state S0 for the next round. As demonstrated in Figure 3, which provides more interactive 4D scenes, each with three rounds of inter-action, PerpetualWonder can support sequential interactions for diverse object types such as elastic bodies, gases, and rigid objects, all while generating realistic physical motion.

In the top row of Figure 6, we show the dynamic scene rep-resented by VPP after multi-view optimization. The VPP representation constrains visual primitives {gj,k } to remain near their corresponding physics particle pj . This binding mechanism accurately drives the visual primitives accord-ing to the dynamics from physical solvers. We contrast this with a variant (bottom row) that uses standard 3D gaussian primitives. When subjected to the same multi-view opti-mization, these unconstrained primitives just aim for mini-mizing the photometric loss, resulting in degenerate results with chaotic dynamics and visual artifacts. 

Progressive optimization enhances the multi-view con-sistency. In Figure 7, we ablate our progressive optimiza-tion strategy (top row) against a direct optimization vari-ant (bottom row). In direct optimization, video generators will not naturally generate perfectly consistent multi-view videos. For example, the generated video from the frontal 8view might hallucinate incorrect visual details (e.g., color or shape artifacts), while another view does not, leading to optimization conflicts. By using these inconsistent su-pervision signals to optimize the underlying scene at once, the representation becomes corrupted, which manifests as blurry textures and appearance flickering on the apple as time progresses. Our progressive approach successfully re-solves this ambiguity, yielding a consistent 4D scene. 

# 5. Conclusion 

We introduce PerpetualWonder, a novel framework for long-horizon action-conditioned 4D scene generation from a single image. PerpetualWonder enables sequential inter-actions by unifying the physical and visual representations, and leveraging multi-view optimization for consistent up-dates. We demonstrate the superior performance of Perpet-ualWonder with diverse scenes and long-horizon actions.

11 PerpetualWonder: Long-Horizon Action-Conditioned 4D Scene Generation 

# Supplementary Material 

# A. Dense View Generation 

Our goal is to generate dense, wide-range views of the un-derlying scene with the objects of interest from a single input image. The key here is to generate dense surround-ing views with the scene content in the center and leverage the existing 3D reconstruction pipeline to reconstruct the underlying 3D scene. This approach is fundamentally dif-ferent from the original image to 3D scene pipeline from WonderPlay [21]. The previous pipeline relies heavily on the single-view depth estimation and the alignment between the original image and the inpainted regions, resulting in a 3D scene representation that can only be viewed in a nar-row baseline. On the contrary, our current approach leads to a full, complete 3D scene that supports rendering from arbitrary viewpoints. For dense view generation, we employ GEN3C [34], which is capable of generating 3D-consistent multi-view videos from a single image. GEN3C is trained to gener-ate multi-view videos of the underlying static scene, mak-ing it suitable for scene initialization. However, the vanilla GEN3C requires the generation to start from the input view. This presents a new challenge: generating a single, wide-angle ( 180 ◦ viewpoint change) camera trajectory of-ten leads to inconsistent artifacts as the view deviates too far from the source (i.e., input image). To acquire a dense set of novel views while maintaining consistency, we split the required camera viewpoint changes into two separate trajectories: “arc left” and “arc right”. Both trajectories originate from the input view and rotate in different directions, with a 90 ◦ viewpoint change for each trajectory. We then generate a video for each trajectory and aggregate all the frames, forming a final, wide and consis-tent set of partial orbital views for the scene. These generated dense views are further leveraged by our scene reconstruction pipeline for underlying 3D scene re-construction, and also combined with SAM2 [31] and Gaus-sian Grouping [52] for foreground object segmentation. 

# B. Object Mesh Generation 

Our pipeline further exploits TSDFusion [55] to reconstruct the mesh for the foreground objects. However, we em-pirically find that this approach is suitable for highly de-formable materials like fluid and granular objects, but for rigid objects, the texture and geometry artifacts from incom-plete TSDFusion reconstruction can pose severe challenges for the video generation model and lead to unexpected hal-lucination during the video refinement process. To enhance the robustness of meshes for rigid objects, we exploit additional steps to improve the reconstruction quality for objects of this material. Specifically, we intro-duce Hunyuan3D [61], a powerful object-level image to 3D model. We directly leverage Hunyuan3D to generate the object mesh for rigid body objects, resulting in a complete surface mesh with much better quality compared to simple TSDFusion reconstruction, especially in the back regions. Unlike the non-robust depth alignment and manual ob-ject placement steps in WonderPlay, we can further bene-fit from our aforementioned dense view generation pipeline and automatically position this generated mesh into the scene. Leveraging our synthesized multi-view images, we optimize the 6-DoF pose and scale by minimizing the pro-jection error with respect to the surrounding views, ensuring it is perfectly aligned within the 3D scene. 

# C. Physical Simulation Parameters 

The forward physics pass employs various solvers, and each solver requires specific physical parameter settings for rea-sonable simulation [19]. We provide a comprehensive list of these parameters, along with their default values, in Ta-ble S1. In practice, following the common practice in Won-derPlay, these parameters are initially estimated using a Vision-Language Model [16] and are subject to optional manual fine-tuning to ensure physically plausible simula-tion results. 

# D. Visual-physical aligned Particle Configura-tion 

While our VPP representation generally supports binding multiple gaussian primitives to a single physics particle, forming a set of size K, in practice, we configure K and the gaussian scale adaptively based on material properties to ensure optimal visual-physical alignment: • Solid and Surface Materials (Rigid body, Cloth): We set K = 1 . In this configuration, the gaussian scale is ini-tialized to match the particle size δ. This strict one-to-one mapping ensures that the visual appearance is tightly con-strained by the physics simulation, effectively prevent-ing visual artifacts such as ghosting or detachment during large deformations. • Volumetric and Emitter Materials (Gas, Liquid, Sand, Snow, Elastic object): To adequately represent the vol-umetric expansion and semi-transparent nature of these materials, we set K = 20 to allow a single physics parti-cle to cover a larger visual volume. Correspondingly, the VPP’s gaussian scale is initialized to be smaller than the S1 isotropic primitives ani sotropic primitives Figure S1.

particle size, defaulting to 0.5δ, to represent fine-grained volumetric details within the particle’s influence radius. 

# E. Isotropic Visual Primitives 

We demonstrate the differences between isotropic and anisotropic visual primitives in Figure S1. We find that isotropic primitives help remove blurry artifacts in novel views, as they do not tend to overfit the input image. 

# F. Ablation on Radius 

We show an ablation on particle radius in Figure S2. The default radius is set to δ. Within a reasonable range (from 

0.25 δ to 4δ), our results are robust to different values. How-ever, an overly small radius ( ≤ 0.01 δ) leads to insuffi-cient representational capability, and an overly large radius (≥ 100 δ) leads to instability in optimization. 

# G. Limitation Discussion and Failure Case. 

We provide the detailed runtime breakdown in Table S2. PerpetualWonder is currently not real-time due to the back-ward optimization overhead. Figure S3 shows a failure case involving a hockey stick moving into the frame from out-of-view. In the middle, as the stick enters the field of view, it appears incomplete (a hockey stick should ideally be longer than it appears). It remains a future work to complete object geometry that is not seen in the input image. Parameter Default Value

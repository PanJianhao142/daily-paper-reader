## Abstract 

Stochastic interpolants unify flows and diffusions, popular generative modeling frameworks. A pri-mary hyperparameter in these methods is the inter-polation schedule that determines how to bridge a standard Gaussian base measure to an arbi-trary target measure. We prove how to convert a sample path of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with arbitrary diffusion coefficient under any schedule into the unique sample path under another arbitrary schedule and diffusion coeffi-cient. We then extend the stochastic interpolant framework to admit a larger class of point mass schedules in which the Gaussian base measure collapses to a point mass measure. Under the as-sumption of Gaussian data, we identify lazy sched-ule families that make the drift identically zero and show that with deterministic sampling one gets a variance-preserving schedule commonly used in diffusion models, whereas with statisti-cally optimal SDE sampling one gets our point mass schedule. Finally, to demonstrate the useful-ness of our theoretical results on realistic highly non-Gaussian data, we apply our lazy schedule conversion to a state-of-the-art pretrained flow model and show that this allows for generating im-ages in fewer steps without retraining the model. 

## 1. Background 

A basic goal of generative AI is to sample from a non-trivial target distribution, potentially in a very high-dimensional space, accessible only through a finite dataset of samples. Specifically, let X(1) , X (2) , . . . , X (N ) ∈ Rd be i.i.d. sam-ples from an unknown distribution with density ρX . We then wish to generate new samples X ∼ ρX .

Various techniques for solving this basic generative prob-lem exist. Many modern methods are based on dynamical systems . The idea is to learn the dynamics of a dynamical system with an analytically samplable initial law, typically taken to be standard Gaussian, and with final law ρX . Sam-ples from ρX can then be generated by sampling from a standard Gaussian and integrating the dynamics from the initial to the final time. We will use the flexible framework of stochastic interpolants 

(Albergo et al., 2025) which unifies flow and diffusion based generative models. We briefly introduce this framework and then state our contributions. 

1.1. Spatially linear stochastic interpolant 

The stochastic interpolant framework allows one to couple arbitrary distributions, and even arbitrarily many of them (Albergo et al., 2024), possibly in spatially non-linear ways and even using matrix coefficients (Negrel et al., 2025). We will exclusively work with the simplest and most commonly encountered setting, namely the “spatially linear one-sided stochastic interpolant” (Albergo et al., 2025, eq. 4.15) which we denote stochastic interpolant or just interpolant . Below we recall its definition and some core results. 

Definition 1.1 (stochastic interpolant) . Given independent random variables Z, X ∈ Rd with Z ∼ N (0 , I), X ∼ ρX

and non-negative scalar functions α, β : [0 , 1] → [0 , ∞)

satisfying the below criteria, the stochastic interpolant or simply interpolant is the stochastic process 

It = αtZ + βtX, t ∈ [0 , 1] ,

with α, β ∈ C1([0 , 1]) satisfying the boundary conditions 

α0 = β1 = 1 , α 1 = β0 = 0 and the monotonicity condi-tions ˙αt < 0 and ˙βt > 0 for all t ∈ (0 , 1) .1

Note that I0 ∼ N (0 , I) and I1 ∼ ρX for all valid choices of α, β .One of the primary objects of interest is the following.

One can allow for the one-sided derivatives of α and β to explode at either endpoint as long as the one-sided derivatives exist in the extended reals, see Albergo et al. (2025) for a discussion on this. We require bounded derivatives for simplicity.

Figure 1. ODE ( ε ≡ 0) and statistically optimal SDE ( ε = ε∗) sample path under three different interpolation schedules for ρX aGaussian mixture density for which the dynamics are analytically known (Albergo et al., 2025, Appendix A). All paths start in the same initial condition which sits in the initial position (cyan circle) for the leftmost two interpolants with density-admitting schedule and in the initial drift for the rightmost point mass schedule. The same Wiener process realization is shared between all three SDE solutions. Leftmost is the linear schedule from Definition 5.1, middle and rightmost is the lazy interpolant for the ODE and statistically optimal SDE, respectively, as in Example 7.4. Since ut = t for all three schedules, all sample paths are equivalent up to a reparameterization of space. Note that all sample paths end in the same position for the ODE and SDE, respectively. See Figure 4 for a plot of the three schedules and their statistically optimal diffusion scales. 

Definition 1.2 (schedule) . The function pair (α, β ) in Defi-nition 1.1 is the interpolation schedule or simply schedule .The schedule is a hyperparameter that determines how 

N (0 , I) and ρX are bridged in time. A canonical choice is 

αt = 1 − t, β t = t; this is the choice taken in flow matching. To proceed we define the following functions. 

Definition 1.3. For an interpolant as in Definition 1.1 with density ρ : [0 , 1] × Rd → (0 , ∞) and ε : [0 , 1] → [0 , ∞)

we define the following functions for (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd:

ηZ (t, x ) := E[Z | It = x], “noise predictor” 

ηX (t, x ) := E[X | It = x], “data predictor” 

s(t, x ) := ∇ log ρ(t, x ), “score” 

bε(t, x ) := ˙ αtηZ (t, x ) + ˙βtηX (t, x ) + εts(t, x ). “drift” The central idea behind the stochastic interpolant framework is to construct a family of stochastic differential equations 

(SDEs) indexed by an arbitrary time-dependent additive diffusion scale ε : [0 , 1] → [0 , ∞), whose solutions have the same marginal distributions (but different joint distributions) as It, as captured in the following theorem (Albergo et al., 2025, Corollary 18). 

Theorem 1.4 (SDE) . Let εt ∈ C1([0 , 1]) be any non-negative scalar function. Then the solutions to the SDE 

dXεt = bε(t, X εt ) d t + √2εt dWt, (1) 

solved forward in time t with Xε 

> 0

∼ N (0 , I) independent of 

W , satisfy Law( Xεt ) = Law( It) for all t ∈ [0 , 1] .

With the above result we can pick any non-negative diffusion scale ε, sample Xε 

> 0

∼ N (0 , I) and solve the SDE forward in time from t = 0 to t = 1 provided we know the drift 

bε. Then Xε 

> 1

∼ ρX , as desired. In particular, setting ε ≡ 0

gives a deterministic probability flow ODE. Each function in Definition 1.3 can be characterized as the minimizer of a simple squared-loss objective, enabling unbi-ased Monte-Carlo estimation from data without simulating the SDE. One then uses the learned estimate of the dynam-ics to generate data, e.g. one learns ˆbε ≈ bε from data and solves the SDE (1) with bε replaced by ˆbε to sample 

ˆX ∼ ˆρX ≈ ρX .Throughout we assume the following, the validity of which depends on the properties of ρX , the smoothness of (α, β )

and the choice of ε (see Albergo et al. (2025) for details). 

Assumption 1.5. The data density satisfies ρX (x) > 0 for all x ∈ Rd, and the density ρ : [0 , 1] × Rd → (0 , ∞) of the interpolant satisfies ρ(·, x ) ∈ C1([0 , 1]) for all x ∈ Rd,

ρ(t, ·) ∈ C2(Rd) for all t ∈ [0 , 1] , and similarly for the functions in Definition 1.3. Furthermore, the SDE (1) has a unique strong solution for all initial conditions. 

## 2. Contributions 

1. In Theorem 5.5 we generalize existing results from the ODE to the SDE setting and show that we can uniquely convert any strong solution to the SDE (1) with arbi-trary schedule and diffusion scale into the corresponding strong solution to the SDE (1) with an arbitrary different schedule and diffusion scale. 2. In Definition 6.1 and Theorem 6.3 we extend the interpo-lation schedule to include the point mass boundary con-dition α0 = 0 and give sufficient conditions for the SDE to exist in this extended setting with normally distributed initial conditions that sit in the initial drift instead of in the initial position. We stress that this result even holds in the ODE case, i.e. when ε ≡ 0.3. Assuming that X ∼ N (0 , I) we prove in Proposition 7.1 that the lazy schedule family – the family of schedules such that the dynamics become identically zero – for 2Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants

α0 = 0 in the latter case, which motivates our schedule extension to the point mass case. 4. In Propositions 7.5 and 7.6 and Algorithms 1 and 2 we de-rive particularly simple and theoretically well-motivated formulas for reparameterizing space (but not time) in any pretrained flow matching model with linear schedule 

αt = 1 − t, β t = t to yield a lazy ODE and statistically optimal SDE schedule, respectively. 5. In Section 8 we conduct empirical experiments with a state-of-the-art flow matching model for natural image generation and show that using this reparameterization allows for fewer-step numerical sampling in the ODE case and especially so for the statistically optimal SDE, which is otherwise numerically undefined at t = 0 .

## 3. Related work 

The stochastic interpolant framework (Albergo et al., 2025) unifies existing continuous-time generative paradigms based on dynamical systems, namely flow matching (Lipman et al., 2023) and diffusion models 2 (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Song & Ermon, 2019; Song et al., 2021) by disentangling the two primary hyperparameters: the interpolation sched-ule coupling the Gaussian and data distribution in time, and the stochasticity of the stochastic process that samples this coupling. The optimal level of stochasticity has mostly been explored in the stochastic interpolant literature (Albergo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025), whereas more work exists on tuning the interpolation schedule with the aim of easing numerical integration, albeit often heuristically or empirically based (Nichol & Dhari-wal, 2021; Karras et al., 2022; Song & Ermon, 2020; Xue et al., 2024). Our work is primarily inspired by Chen et al. (2025), but by considering the statistically optimal SDE in-stead of just the ODE we arrive at point mass schedules for which little work exists (Albergo et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2024). Our work also resembles Sabour et al. (2024), but in addition to time reparameterizations we also consider space reparameterizations, even extending to point mass schedules. Changing the interpolation schedule post-training has re-cently been explored for ODE sampling (Liu, 2024; Lai et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), but to the best of our knowl-edge pathwise equivalence has never been established for SDE sampling before. More sophisticated approaches for sampling from flow and diffusion models in fewer steps exist; some notable exam-

ples are flow rectification (Liu et al., 2023), consistency models (Song et al., 2023; Boffi et al., 2025) and (entropy regularized) optimal transport based approaches (Pooladian et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023; Bortoli et al., 2021; Poola-dian & Niles-Weed, 2025). These approaches are mostly supplementary to the choice of schedule that we explore. 

## 4. Intra-interpolant conversion formulas 

In this section we fix the schedule (α, β ) and show how to convert between the functions in Definition 1.3. The proofs can be found in Appendix A. The following diffusion scale plays an important role in our work. We define it now and motivate it later. 

Definition 4.1. Given an interpolation schedule (α, β ) satis-fying the criteria in Definition 1.1 we denote by ε∗ 

> t

: [0 , 1] →

[0 , ∞] the scalar function 

ε∗ 

> t

= α2

> t

˙βt

βt

− αt ˙αt,

where at t = 0 the equation is interpreted as a right-limit in the extended reals. We start by showing that for a fixed interpolation schedule 

(α, β ), any one of the functions from Definition 1.3 uniquely defines all remaining functions through affine transforma-tions that simplify using the above definition for ε∗. This result generalizes the well-known result relating the score to the noise predictor (Albergo et al., 2025, Theorem 8) and Lai et al. (2025, Proposition 6.3.1) for the ODE case ε ≡ 0.

Proposition 4.2 (intra-interpolant conversion formulas) .

For a fixed interpolation schedule (α, β ) and non-negative 

ε ∈ C1([0 , 1]) , each of the functions ηZ , η X , s, b ε uniquely defines all of the others on (0 , 1) × Rd. In particular, each function can be expressed in terms of the score as 

ηZ (t, x ) = −αts(t, x ),ηX (t, x ) =  x + α2 

> t

s(t, x )/β t,bε(t, x ) = ( ε∗ 

> t

+ εt)s(t, x ) + ( ˙βt/β t)x. 

The next theorem characterizes ε∗ as the statistically opti-mal diffusion scale in a precise sense. This is essentially equation 13 in Chen et al. (2024) but our proof is simpler. 

Theorem 4.3. Assume we are given statistically learnt es-timates ˆηZ , ˆηX , ˆs or ˆbε of the true functions from Defini-tion 1.3 with remaining estimates given by Proposition 4.2. Let Xεt solve the SDE (1) and consider the plug-in SDE 

d ˆXεt = ˆbε(t, ˆXεt ) d t + √2εt dWt,

solved forward in time t with ˆXε

Unfortunately, the statistically optimal diffusion scale ε∗

is ill-behaved numerically in the sense that for any sched-ule (α, β ) satisfying Definition 1.1 it is infinite and non-integrable at t = 0 (Proposition B.1). Nonetheless, the sta-tistically optimal SDE , i.e., the SDE (1) with ε = ε∗, is well-defined on t ∈ (0 , 1] and behaves like a (non-continuous) white-noise process as t → 0+. See Proposition B.5 which proves an equivalence between ε∗, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and diffusion models. 

## 5. Inter-interpolant conversion formulas 

We now show how to convert the functions from Defini-tion 1.3 from one schedule to another and how to convert be-tween solutions to the SDEs. The following linear schedule 

used in flow matching simplifies the conversion formulas. 

Definition 5.1 (linear interpolant) . Let αt := 1 − t, β t := t.Then we denote by It := αtZ + βtX the linear interpolant .We denote by ηZ , η X , s, b ε its associated functions as in Definition 1.3 and by Xεt its associated SDE (1). 

Proposition 5.2. For the linear interpolant It from Defini-tion 5.1 it holds that ε∗ 

> t

= (1 − t)/t . Therefore 

Z ts

2ε∗ 

> u

du = 2(log( t) − t − log( s) + s)

for 0 < s ≤ t ≤ 1 and the integral is infinite for s = 0 .

Definition 5.3. For t ∈ [0 , 1] we define the functions 

ct := αt + βt, ut := βt/c t.

The interpretation is that c is a (generally non-invertible) space-change while u is a proper time change. Indeed, the monotonicity assumptions on the schedule (α, β ) in Defini-tion 1.1 imply that u ∈ C1([0 , 1]) and is strictly increasing on (0 , 1) so that its inverse tu := u−1(u) exists. The following proposition can be seen as a supplement to Proposition 4.2. It rephrases and generalizes proposition 3.1 from Chen et al. (2025) and proposition 6.3.3 from Lai et al. (2025) which only consider the ODE case ( ε ≡ 0). 

Proposition 5.4 (inter-conversion formulas) . For a sched-ule (α, β ) and non-negative ε ∈ C1([0 , 1]) , the functions 

ηZ , η X , s, b ε are uniquely defined from any of the functions 

ηZ , η X , s, b ε associated with the linear interpolant. In par-ticular, 

ηZ (t, x ) = ηZ (ut, x/c t), ηX (t, x ) = ηX (ut, x/c t),s(t, x ) = (1 /c t)s(ut, x/c t),bε(t, x ) = ˙ct

We finally prove our strongest conversion result, which to the best of our knowledge is new for ε̸ ≡ 0.

Theorem 5.5 (pathwise conversion) . Let (α, β ) be a sched-ule satisfying the requirements in Definition 1.1, let z ∈ Rd

and let (Wt)t∈[0 ,1] be a Wiener process realization. Let Xεt

solve the SDE (1) in physical time t from Xε

= z driven by W with diffusion scale ε. Let Xεu solve the SDE (1) 

with linear schedule in reparameterized time u = ut from

). Then the so-lution Xεt can be obtained from the solution Xεut associated with the linear interpolant via the formula 

Xεt = ctXεut , t ∈ [0 , 1] .

In particular, Xε 

> 1

= Xε 

> 1

(since c1 = 1 ). 

With this result, we can sample paths from the interpolant with any schedule and any diffusion scale provided we can sample paths from the linear interpolant (simply apply The-orem 5.5 twice to convert from an arbitrary schedule instead of the linear schedule). This is illustrated in the two leftmost plots in Figure 1 for the ODE and statistically optimal SDE, respectively. 

Remark 5.6 . We shall see that the identity time-transform 

ut = t is of particular interest. Then Theorem 5.5 simplifies significantly, in particular, W = W .

## 6. Point mass schedule 

We use the preceding results to extend Definition 1.1 to transport to the target distribution from a point mass instead of a (non-degenerate) Gaussian. We delay the motivation to the next section. 

Definition 6.1 (point mass schedule and interpolant) . Afunction pair α, β ∈ C1([0 , 1]) satisfying 1. α0 = α1 = β0 = 0 , β 1 = 1 ,2. αt > 0, ˙βt > 0 for all t ∈ (0 , 1) ,4Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

3. βt = o(αt) as t → 0+ (equivalently u0 = 0 ), 4. α2 

> t

= O(βt) as t → 0+,5. ˙u0 := lim t→0+ ˙ut < ∞,6. ddt (βt/α t) > 0 for all t ∈ (0 , 1) (equivalently ˙ut > 0), we call a point mass schedule . The associated interpolant we call a point mass interpolant .

Remark 6.2 . The condition α0 = β0 = 0 is sufficient and necessary for the density of the interpolant to collapse to a point mass at t = 0 . The condition u0 = 0 is sufficient and necessary for the initial drift to be analytically samplable; if otherwise u0 > 0 we would have to sample the non-trivial law of Iu0̸ = I0 to sample the initial drift, which is impossible in practice. The condition α2 

> t

= O(βt) as t →

0+ is technical and can be relaxed; see the remarks at the end of the proof of Theorem 6.3. The assumption ˙u0 < ∞

gives u ∈ C1([0 , 1]) , which is not strictly necessary but we impose it for simplicity. The last assumption is equivalent to ˙ut > 0 for all t ∈ (0 , 1) so that t 7 → ut is a proper time change. Remarkably, the initial drift of the point mass interpolant can be defined pointwise from the initial condition of the linear interpolant, even in the ODE case, as we show below. 

Theorem 6.3. Let (α, β ) be a point mass schedule as in Def-inition 6.1. Then given any non-negative bounded diffusion scale ε ∈ C1([0 , 1]) , the SDE (1) is well-defined in the clas-sical sense for t ∈ (0 , 1] with initial position Xε 

> 0

= 0 , and the initial drift is well-defined in distribution. It holds that 

Law( Xεt ) = Law( It) for all t ∈ [0 , 1] and Theorem 5.5 still applies: in particular, the point mass SDE solution and initial drift relates to the solution and initial condition of the linear interpolant as Xεt = ctXεut for t ∈ [0 , 1] and 

bε(0 , X ε 

> 0

) =   ˙c0 − lim t→0+ (εt/α t)Xε

> 0

.Remark 6.4 . The initial drift in Theorem 6.3 is always bounded for the ODE case ε ≡ 0, whereas for the SDE case it is bounded if and only if we choose the diffusion scale such that εt ∈ O(αt) as t → 0+.Theorem 6.3 shows that while the normally distributed ini-tial condition sits at the initial position for the density-admitting stochastic interpolant from Definition 1.1, the initial condition instead sits at the initial SDE drift (or ODE velocity when ε ≡ 0) for the point mass interpolant from Definition 6.1. To the best of our knowledge such a non-standard ODE has not been considered before in the flow or diffusion literature, whereas the SDE has been treated in slightly different settings in Albergo et al. (2025); Chen et al. (2024). A sample path from a point mass interpolant is plotted to-gether with its linear interpolant path in Figure 1 for the ODE and statistically optimal SDE, respectively. We finally extend proposition 2.5 from Chen et al. (2025) to the point mass setting. 

Proposition 6.5. Let (α, β ) be any valid schedule, possibly a point mass schedule. Then under the assumptions in Theo-rem 4.3, the minimal path-measure KL-divergence attained when ε = ε∗ is invariant to the choice of schedule. 

Proposition 6.5 dictates that we must optimize the schedule for some criterion different from statistical optimality, which is what we do in the next section. 

## 7. Lazy schedules under Gaussian data assumption 

In this section, we make the oversimplifying assumption that X ∼ N (0 , I). This allows us to identify families of schedules for which the SDE drift is identically zero, the motivation being that such schedules minimize the en-ergy required to transport from base to target measure. We call these schedules lazy . In the experimental section, we demonstrate empirically that the results we obtain under the Gaussian data assumption are useful even in realistic, high-dimensional and highly non-Gaussian settings. 

7.1. Relation to flows and diffusions 

To simplify the presentation we focus on two natural choices for the diffusion scale: ε ≡ 0 and ε = ε∗.The former corresponds to ODE sampling and reduces to standard flow matching under the linear interpolant (see Definition 5.1). The latter reduces to sampling a time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as in diffusion model-ing (Proposition B.5) and we will henceforth refer to this as “statistically optimal SDE sampling”. Numerical integration is simpler for ODE sampling, but statistically optimal SDE sampling is maximally robust to approximation errors in the learned drift estimate as per Theorem 4.3. Throughout we use the notation b := bε≡0 for the ODE velocity and 

b∗ := bε=ε∗

for the statistically optimal SDE drift. 

7.2. Identifying lazy schedules 

Requiring the velocity and drift to be identically zero un-der the Gaussian data assumption removes one degree of freedom in the schedule. 

Proposition 7.1 (lazy schedule families) . Assume that X ∼N (0 , I). Then for all (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd it holds that 1. 

b(t, x ) = 0 ⇐⇒ α2 

> t

+ β2 

> t

= 1 .

In words, the ODE velocity is identically zero if and only if the schedule is variance preserving. 2. 

b∗(t, x ) = 0 ⇐⇒ α2 

> t

+ β2 

> t

= βt.

5Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

This implies α0 = 0 , β t = o(αt), α 2 

> t

= O(βt) as t →

0+. We have that ˙u0 < ∞ ⇐⇒ ˙βt = O(√βt) in which case the schedule is a point mass schedule per Definition 6.1. It also holds for all t ∈ [0 , 1] that ε∗ 

> t

=˙βt/2 so that

du = βt − βs for 0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ 1.

Proposition 7.1 curiously shows that requiring the ODE ve-locity to be identically zero under the Gaussian data assump-tion amounts to choosing a variance preserving schedule, which is typically used in diffusion models but not in flow models. On the other hand, for statistically optimal SDE sampling it instead leads to point mass schedule, which is underexplored in the literature. 

Remark 7.2 . From Proposition 7.1 together with the in-evitable boundary conditions β0 = 0 , β 1 = 1 we see that 

R 10 2ε∗ 

> u

du = 1 , i.e. the quadratic variation of the martingale part of solutions to our SDE from t = 0 to t = 1 are fixed at 1. This is remarkable since for α0 = 1 the same integral is fixed at ∞ by Proposition B.1. This result holds even when X is not normally distributed. However, one easily shows that normalizing this quadratic variation by the total variance gives R t

(2 ε∗

)/β u du = [log( βu)] t 

> 0

= ∞ for all 

t ∈ (0 , 1] , resembling the result from Proposition B.1. A natural next question is how to eliminate the last degree of freedom. We give two natural examples below and then discuss why the second example is useful in practice. 

Example 7.3 (βt = t). Setting βt = t gives, in the ODE case, αt = √1 − t2. Interestingly, this is not the usual lin-ear schedule used in flow matching models. Also ˙α1 = −∞ .Considering instead the SDE case we get αt = pt(1 − t)

and 2ε∗ 

> t

= 1 . When X ∼ N (0 , I), the solution to the SDE is a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion (Wt)t∈[0 ,1] 

with W0 = 0 . Also ˙α0 = ∞ and ˙α1 = −∞ . The endpoint explosion of ˙α in these schedules is worrisome. 

Example 7.4 (ut = t). Define dt := (1 − t)2 + t2. Then for the ODE case requiring ut = t gives the schedule αt =(1 − t)/√dt, β t = t/ √dt. Then ˙α0 = 0 , ˙α1 = −1 and 

˙β0 = 1 , ˙β1 = 0 . Considering instead the SDE case gives the schedule αt = t(1 − t)/d t, β t = t2/d t which is a point mass schedule per Proposition 7.1 since ˙βt = O(√βt) as 

t → 0+. We now have ˙α0 = 1 , ˙α1 = −1 and ˙β0 =˙β1 = ε∗

= ε∗

= 0 , and also ˙c0 = 1 = lim t→0+ ε∗ 

> t

/α t so that the initial drift is zero per Theorem 6.3. The fact that all functions are bounded everywhere in both schedules is attractive from a numerical perspective. 

We can further characterize and motivate the constraint 

ut = t in Example 7.4 as follows. Consider the log-signal-to-noise ratio λt := log( β2 

> t

/α 2 

> t

). Thus, λ0 = −∞ and 

λ1 = ∞.3 It might be natural to require λt to be linear

in logit-time . Specifically, define τ (t) := 2 log( t/ (1 − t)) ,with inverse t(τ ) = (1 + exp( −τ / 2)) −1, i.e. the logistic function with growth rate 1/2. Then requiring λt = τ (t) is equivalent to requiring ut = t.

7.3. Lazy schedule transformation of a pretrained flow matching model 

Based on what we have shown so far, we can convert any flow or diffusion model (more generally any stochastic in-terpolant) with an arbitrary schedule to its corresponding lazy schedule variant (under the Gaussian assumption). The motivation is that numerically solving the ODE or SDE is easier when the dynamics are gentle. That the dynamics in practice become gentler under the lazy schedule even when we seriously violate the Gaussian data assumption is strongly suggested by the empirical results in the next sec-tion. To make the schedule conversion particularly simple, we focus on the ut = t case considered in Example 7.4. We focus on converting from a flow matching model ve-locity vflow , which is identical to the linear ODE velocity 

b of the linear interpolant It from Definition 5.1 (see also Appendix B.1). 

Proposition 7.5 (linear velocity to lazy ODE velocity) . De-fine the schedule 

αt := (1 − t)/pdt, βt := t/ pdt, dt := (1 − t)2 + t2,

as in Example 7.4 and assume we are given access to the ODE velocity b = vflow of the linear interpolant from Defini-tion 5.1. Then the velocity satisfies 

b(t, x ) = ((1 − 2t)/(dt)) x + (1 /pdt)b(t, pdtx),

for all (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd. In particular, the initial velocity satisfies 

b(0 , z ) = z + b(0 , z ) = E[X] ∀z ∈ Rd.

Proposition 7.6 (linear velocity to lazy SDE drift) . Define the schedule 

αt := t(1 − t)/d t, βt := t2/d t, dt := (1 − t)2 + t2,

as in Example 7.4 and assume we are given access to the ODE velocity b = vflow of the linear interpolant from Defini-tion 5.1. Then the statistically optimal SDE drift satisfies 

b∗(t, x ) = (2 /d t)((1 − 2t)x + tb (t, (dt/t )x)) ,

for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1] × Rd, and the initial drift is identically zero, i.e. b∗(0 , 0) = 0 .

We can restate Propositions 7.5 and 7.6 as particularly sim-ple algorithms for how to solve the lazy ODE and SDE using    

> limit lim t→0+βt/α t= 0 .

Sample images from the PRX flow model with a varying number of predictor-corrector steps for the ODE and statistically optimal SDE, respectively, sampled using the original linear flow model schedule versus converting to the lazy schedule. The text prompt “A car is stopped at a red light” was used. As expected, the image quality improves as the number of solver steps increases and seems to converge to the “ground truth” reference image which depends on whether an ODE or SDE is used but less so on which schedule is used.

the linear ODE velocity. Pseudocode for these algorithms is given in Algorithms 1 and 2. We stress that we can prove results similar to Proposi-tions 7.5 and 7.6 but from a pretrained diffusion model instead of flow model, or more generally from a pretrained stochastic interpolant with any schedule and any training objective. This is omitted for brevity. 

Remark 7.7 . Note that Propositions 7.5 and 7.6 generally do not hold exactly when we only have access to an approx-imate linear flow velocity ˆvflow ≈ vflow learned from data, as is always the case in practice. 

## 8. Experiments 

To investigate the usefulness of our lazy schedules in realis-tic, high-dimensional settings with highly non-Gaussian data we conduct experiments on the latest, largest Pho-toroom Experimental (PRX) text-to-image classifier-free guided latent-space flow model (Photoroom, 2025; Almaz ´an et al., 2025; Lipman et al., 2023; Ho & Salimans, 2022) which has around 1.3 billion parameters and is currently in beta 4. We fix the guidance strength at the recommended value of 5 and wish to investigate whether dynamically con-verting to the lazy schedules using Propositions 7.5 and 7.6 as described in detail in Algorithms 1 and 2 enables us to generate good images in fewer steps using the ODE and

statistically optimal SDE, respectively. We use the predictor-corrector scheme which informally is a mix between the explicit Euler(-Maruyama) scheme and the Heun scheme and which we find is the most efficient of the three. See Appendix E for a precise definition of each scheme and some sample image comparisons. Instead of looking at standard but arbitrary goodness-of-image metrics such as Fr ´echet Inception distance (Heusel et al., 2017) and Inception score (Salimans et al., 2016), we look at how fast the predictor-corrector solver converges to the idealized “ground truth” reference image as a function of the total number of numerical solver steps ni. Since the idealized “ground truth” reference image is unattainable in practice, we define it as the average image after nk =4096 ≈ ∞ solver steps, i.e., 

img ODE reference := ( img ODE,flow  

> 4096

+ img ODE,lazy  

> 4096

)/2,

and similarly for the SDE. This is reasonable since in the idealized setting where ˆvflow = vflow , i.e. when the flow ve-locity is learned perfectly, then img ODE,flow  

> ∞

= img ODE,lazy  

> ∞

,and similarly for the SDE. Results where img ODE reference := 

img ODE,flow  

> 4096

is used instead are shown in Figure 9. As text prompts we use the first 100 captions from the COCO validation dataset (Lin et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015) as listed in Appendix G. For each experiment we fix a text prompt from our dataset and randomly sample an initial condition and (for SDE generation) a Wiener process real-ization. We let the number of numerical solver steps vary in the range n1 = 4 , n 2 = 8 , . . . , n k = 4096 . This generates 

k = 11 images of increasing quality for each of the four configurations (ODE,SDE) × (flow,lazy) sharing the same prompt, initial condition and Wiener process realiza-tion, as illustrated in Figure 2. We then calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) over pixels 5 between the image produced with ni numerical solver steps and the reference image, i.e. we calculate 

RMSE (img ODE,flow  

> ni

, img ODE reference )

for each i and similarly for img ODE,lazy  

> ni

and the SDE. We repeat this experiment for each of our 100 different prompts, initial conditions and Wiener process realizations and com-pute the average RMSE. This measures numerical conver-gence of the solver under each configuration. 6 The result is plotted in Figure 3 and animations for the generated images for all 100 prompts are accessible at this Zenodo link. Under the linear flow model schedule the statistically op-timal SDE has infinite initial drift and diffusion scale   

> 5This corresponds to a dimension-normalized Euclidean dis-tance in pixel-space.
> 6To be precise, this measures convergence of the latent repre-sentations after decoding, which is more semantically meaningful than convergence in latent space.

Figure 3. Left: Pixel-wise RMSE predictor-corrector convergence plot for ODE (circle markers and solid curves) and statistically optimal SDE (square markers and dashed curves) generation with the original linear flow model schedule versus the converted lazy schedule as in Figure 2. Average and 95% confidence interval (shaded bands) is over 100 prompts, initial conditions and Wiener process realizations. One sees that convergence is (almost) monotone as a function of the number of solver steps for all four configurations. Compare with Figure 8. Right: Visual answer to the question “Using ni numerical solver steps with the lazy schedule, how many solver steps would I on average need to use with the linear flow model schedule to achieve the same RMSE to the reference image?”. The answer for each ni

on the x-axis is plotted on the y-axis (cyan labels indicate nearest rounded integer). Shaded bands indicate 95% confidence intervals. The lazy schedule almost always performs statistically significantly better (and never worse) for both ODE and SDE generation, but the improvement is much bigger for SDE generation. All confidence intervals are calculated by bootstrapping with 10 ,000 samples. 

(Proposition B.1) so it is numerically undefined. To deal with this we sample the first step under the lazy sched-ule; this is easily shown to be equivalent to setting X∗ 

> ∆t

=p(1 − ∆t)2 + (∆ t)2W∆t where W∆t is the initial incre-ment of the fixed Wiener process. In Figure 3 (left) we see that each of the four configurations converges more or less monotonically to its reference image, but convergence is significantly faster with ODE generation than with SDE generation, indicating the difficulty in nu-merically solving SDEs. See also Figure 8 showing that the two SDEs converge more slowly to a common reference image. To test whether the effect of converting to the lazy schedule is statistically significantly positive for ODE and SDE gen-eration, respectively, we ask the following question: “Using 

ni numerical solver steps with the lazy schedule, how many solver steps would I on average need to use with the linear flow model schedule to achieve the same RMSE to the ref-erence image?”. The answer to this question is illustrated in Figure 3 (right). For ODE integration the improvement is statistically significant up until ni = 64 yet quite small; one saves at most three solver steps (which for ni = 4 almost halves the sampling time) using the lazy schedule instead of the original linear flow model schedule. For SDE genera-tion the improvement is much larger; for example, using 128 

predictor-corrector steps with the lazy schedule achieves a performance (on average) similar to using 171 solver steps with the linear flow model schedule. 

## 9. Discussion 

We stress that since the PRX model outputs a learned ap-proximation ˆvflow ≈ vflow the flow-to-lazy conversion is inexact as noted in Remark 7.7. The fact that the lazy sched-ule performs statistically better than the linear flow schedule that the PRX model was trained with is therefore very con-vincing and leads us to hypothesize that training a model from scratch using e.g. the lazy ODE schedule from Exam-ple 7.4 would lead to significantly bigger improvements in sampling quality. We also stress that the slow convergence of the SDE does 

not allow us to conclude that the statistically optimal SDE generates poorer images than the ODE. The more interest-ing metric, which is harder to measure, is distributional fit to the test dataset and the tradeoff between that and ease of numerical integration for the ODE versus the SDE. We leave this to future work but note that the sample images in Appendix F indicate that using a moderate amount of solver steps (say ni ≥ 64 ) for the statistically optimal SDE gener-ates aesthetically pleasing and detailed images, especially with the lazy schedule. On the theoretical side it would be valuable to extend the lazy schedule family beyond the Gaussian data assumption. We hypothesize that for the statistically optimal SDE one will end up with a point mass schedule under reasonable assumptions on the data density ρX .8Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants

## A. Proofs 

Proposition 4.2 (intra-interpolant conversion formulas) . For a fixed interpolation schedule (α, β ) and non-negative 

ε ∈ C1([0 , 1]) , each of the functions ηZ , η X , s, b ε uniquely defines all of the others on (0 , 1) × Rd. In particular, each function can be expressed in terms of the score as 

ηZ (t, x ) = −αts(t, x ),ηX (t, x ) =  x + α2 

> t

s(t, x )/β t,bε(t, x ) = ( ε∗ 

> t

+ εt)s(t, x ) + ( ˙βt/β t)x. 

Proof. For t ∈ (0 , 1) we can clearly isolate the score s in each of the relations in the proposition. It therefore suffices to prove that each of the relations hold for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1) × Rd, as claimed. The first relation is a standard result that can be proved with Stein’s lemma (also known as Gaussian integration by parts )(Stein, 1981) saying that s(t, x ) = −ηZ (t, x )/α t for (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1) × Rd, see e.g. Theorem 8 in Albergo et al. (2025). The second relation follows easily from the definition of the stochastic interpolant (Definition 1.1) It = αtZ + βtX and linearity of expectation. Indeed, taking expectations conditional on It = x in the definition for It gives 

ηX (t, x ) = 1

βt

(x − αtηZ (t, x )) = 1

where we used the first relation to get the last equality. To get the final relation, plug the preceding relations into the definition of the drift 

bε(t, x ) = ˙ αtηZ (t, x ) + ˙βtηX (t, x ) + εts(t, x )= ˙ αt(−αts(t, x )) + ˙βt

Since by Definition 4.1 ε∗

Theorem 4.3. Assume we are given statistically learnt estimates ˆηZ , ˆηX , ˆs or ˆbε of the true functions from Definition 1.3 with remaining estimates given by Proposition 4.2. Let Xεt solve the SDE (1) and consider the plug-in SDE

where in the second equality we used that Law Xεt = Law It and in the third equality we used Proposition 4.2 with the assumptions on ˆb and ˆs in this theorem. From the last expression we see that minimizing the KL-divergence over the diffusion scale ε amounts to minimizing the expression (ε∗

+ εt)2/ε t over εt for all t ∈ [0 , 1] since the expectation term does not depend on εt. Differentiating this expression with respect to εt and setting the resulting expression to zero gives the (unique) minimizer εt = ε∗

for all t ∈ [0 , 1] , and the theorem follows.

ηZ , η X , s, b ε are uniquely defined from any of the functions ηZ , η X , s, b ε associated with the linear interpolant. In particular, 

ηZ (t, x ) = ηZ (ut, x/c t), ηX (t, x ) = ηX (ut, x/c t),s(t, x ) = (1 /c t)s(ut, x/c t),bε(t, x ) = ˙ct

Getting the final relation requires a bit more work, but the overall strategy is the same as for the above; we first convert the drift to the score, then the score to the linear score, and then the linear score to the linear drift using the particular linear diffusion scale εut = ( αtεt)/(βtε∗

). To be precise, we first apply Proposition 4.2, then the relation we just proved, and then Proposition 4.2 again to get

Theorem 5.5 (pathwise conversion) . Let (α, β ) be a schedule satisfying the requirements in Definition 1.1, let z ∈ Rd and let (Wt)t∈[0 ,1] be a Wiener process realization. Let Xεt solve the SDE (1) in physical time t from Xε

). Then the solution Xεt can be obtained from the solution Xεut associated with the linear interpolant via the formula 

Xεt = ctXεut , t ∈ [0 , 1] .

In particular, Xε 

> 1

= Xε 

> 1

(since c1 = 1 ). Proof. First of all we note that W is indeed a Wiener process in reparameterized time u = ut by L ´evy’s characterization theorem (see e.g. Theorem 5.12 in Le Gall (2016)) since it has quadratic variation W u = R tu

˙us ds = R u

. This concludes the proof. To prove Theorem 6.3 we first state and prove a useful lemma. 

Lemma A.2. For any point mass schedule (α, β ) it holds that 

u0 := lim 

> t→0+

ut = 0 ⇐⇒ βt = o(αt) as t → 0+.

Proof. We have that 

u0 := lim 

> t→0+

ut = lim 

> t→0+

βt

αt + βt

= lim 

> t→0+

11 + αt

.

Clearly this limit is zero if and only if the ratio αt/β t → ∞ as t → 0+, or equivalently if and only if βt = o(αt) as 

t → 0+.

Theorem 6.3. Let (α, β ) be a point mass schedule as in Definition 6.1. Then given any non-negative bounded diffusion scale ε ∈ C1([0 , 1]) , the SDE (1) is well-defined in the classical sense for t ∈ (0 , 1] with initial position Xε 

> 0

= 0 , and the initial drift is well-defined in distribution. It holds that Law( Xεt ) = Law( It) for all t ∈ [0 , 1] and Theorem 5.5 still applies: in particular, the point mass SDE solution and initial drift relates to the solution and initial condition of the linear interpolant as Xεt = ctXεut for t ∈ [0 , 1] and bε(0 , X ε

14 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

Proof. Since the point mass schedule from Definition 6.1 only differs from the regular schedule from Definition 1.1 at t = 0 

this is the only case we need to consider. In particular, Theorem 5.5 holds on (0 , 1] and also in the limit as t → 0+ since from the boundary conditions α0 = β0 = 0 we have c0 = u0 = 0 so that Xε 

> 0

= c0Xε 

> 0

= 0 for all (z, ω ) ∈ Rd × Ω with 

z = Xε 

> 0

the initial condition to the linear interpolant and ω an event in the probability space of the shared Wiener process. Substituting now ctx for x in Proposition 5.4 gives the conversion formula 

bε(t, c tx) = ˙ ctx + ct ˙utbε(ut, x ),

for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1) × Rd with εut = αtεt

lim 

> t→0+

bε(t, c tx) = lim

˙ctx + lim

ct ˙utbε(ut, x ),

so it remains to prove that lim t→0+ ct ˙utbε(ut, x ) = − lim t→0+ (εt/α t)x under our assumptions in Definition 6.1. To this end we first consider the expression for the drift of the linear interpolant,

C ∈ R+ since ˙u0 < ∞, α 0 = β0 = 0 , and since the point mass schedule is assumed to satisfy α2

= O(βt) as t → 0+. This concludes the proof. We note that the point mass schedule assumption α2 

> t

= O(βt) as t → 0+ can be relaxed, but this comes at the expense of requiring ηZ (ut, x ) to converge sufficiently fast to x as t → 0+ so that the limiting product lim t→0+ (( α2

˙ut)/β t)( x −

ηZ (ut, x )) still goes to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this requires assuming that the data distribution ρX has sufficiently light tails; see Assumption B.3 and Theorem B.4 in Chen et al. (2024). We feel like our assumption is simpler, and for what is done in this paper the assumption α2 

> t

= O(βt) as t → 0+ is not prohibitively restrictive. 

Proposition 6.5. Let (α, β ) be any valid schedule, possibly a point mass schedule. Then under the assumptions in Theorem 4.3, the minimal path-measure KL-divergence attained when ε = ε∗ is invariant to the choice of schedule. Proof. This is essentially already proved in Proposition 2.5 in Chen et al. (2025) whose proof we restate below using the notation of this paper. Recall that under the assumptions in Theorem 4.3, the minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence between the path measures of Xε and ˆXε over the diffusion scale ε is

Define now the time change η : [0 , 1] → R+ by ηt := αt/β t, let ρη be the probability density function of the random variable Y = X + ηZ for η ∈ [0 , ∞] and denote by s(η, y ) the score of Y 7. Since from Definition 1.1 we can write 

It = αtZ + βtX = βt(X + ηtZ) = βtY we see that the scores are related as

Crucially, we substituted η1 = 0 but also η0 := lim t→0+ ηt = ∞ in the last expression, as in the original proof. We stress that η0 = ∞ holds even for a point mass schedule since in Definition 6.1 we require βt = o(αt) as t → 0+, which is equivalent to requiring u0 = 0 by Lemma A.2. This requirement cannot be relaxed without making the initial law of the resulting interpolant dependent on ρX , which is what we are trying to sample in the first place. Since the final expression for the KL-minimum is independent of the schedule (α, β ), the proof is concluded. 

Proposition 7.1 (lazy schedule families) . Assume that X ∼ N (0 , I). Then for all (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd it holds that 1.

In words, the ODE velocity is identically zero if and only if the schedule is variance preserving. 2.

This implies α0 = 0 , β t = o(αt), α 2

= O(βt) as t → 0+. We have that ˙u0 < ∞ ⇐⇒ ˙βt = O(√βt) in which case the schedule is a point mass schedule per Definition 6.1. It also holds for all t ∈ [0 , 1] that ε∗

). We first consider what this entails for the ODE case and then for the SDE case. It suffices to consider the condition b(t, x ) = 0 for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1) × Rd since by continuity the condition b(t, x ) = 0 for all (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd is then covered too. From Proposition 4.2 with ε ≡ 0 we see that requiring b(t, x ) = 0 for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1) × Rd is equivalent to requiring

Proposition 7.5 (linear velocity to lazy ODE velocity) . Define the schedule 

αt := (1 − t)/pdt, βt := t/ pdt, dt := (1 − t)2 + t2,

17 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

as in Example 7.4 and assume we are given access to the ODE velocity b = vflow of the linear interpolant from Definition 5.1. Then the velocity satisfies 

b(t, x ) = ((1 − 2t)/(dt)) x + (1 /pdt)b(t, pdtx),

for all (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd. In particular, the initial velocity satisfies 

b(0 , z ) = z + b(0 , z ) = E[X] ∀z ∈ Rd.

Proof. Observing that ct = 1 /√dt, ˙ct = (1 − 2t)/(dt

√dt), u t = t, ˙ut = 1 and applying Proposition 5.4 with ε ≡ 0 so that also ε ≡ 0 gives the conversion formula 

b(t, x ) = 1 − 2tdt

b(t, pdtx).

In particular, since d0 = 1 and u0 = 0 we get 

b(0 , z ) = z + b(0 , z ) = z + E[X | Z = z] − E[Z | Z = z] = E[X].

Note that all equations are well-defined even when t ∈ { 0, 1}. This concludes the proof.

for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1] × Rd, and the initial drift is identically zero, i.e. b∗(0 , 0) = 0 .Proof. Observing that ct = t/d t, ˙ct = (1 − 2t2)/d 2

## B. Relationship to flows and diffusions 

In this section we rigorously describe how the stochastic interpolant from Definition 1.1 relates to the objects studied in flow and diffusion models, respectively. The relationship to diffusion models is analyzed in section 5.1 in (Albergo et al., 2025) but to the best of our knowledge the particular connection to the statistically optimal diffusion scale ε∗ (see Definition 4.1 and Theorem 4.3) as presented in Proposition B.5 has not been pointed out before. First we prove some fundamental properties of the optimal diffusion scale ε∗.

Proposition B.1. For any schedule (α, β ) satisfying the criteria in Definition 1.1, ε∗ from Definition 4.1 satisfies 

ε∗

ε∗

Proof. We have

if lim t→0+ ( ˙βt/β t) exists since α0 = 1 , | ˙α0| < ∞, β 0 = 0 as well as βt > 0 for t > 0. Strict positivity of ε∗ for 

t ∈ (0 , 1) follows from the monotonicity assumptions ˙αt < 0 and ˙βt > 0 for all t ∈ (0 , 1) . ε∗ 

> 1

= 0 follows from 

α1 = 0 , β 1 = 1 , | ˙α1| < ∞, | ˙β1| < ∞.To see that ε∗ is not integrable, we use ˙αt < 0 for t ∈ (0 , 1) to bound ε∗

(log( βt) − lim

log( βs)) = ∞ ∀t ∈ (0 , 1] ,

since β0 = 0 and β ∈ C1([0 , 1]) . This concludes the proof. 

B.1. Flow models 

In a flow model (or more precisely a flow matching model ) one considers the time-dependent random variable (1 − t)Z + tX 

for Z ∼ N (0 , I) and X ∼ ρX independent with t ∈ [0 , 1] . One then utilizes that the ODE 

ddt Y flow  

> t

= vflow (t, Y flow  

> t

)

with velocity field 

vflow (t, x ) := E[X | (1 − t)Z + tX ] − E[Z | (1 − t)Z + tX ]

for (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd generates ρX , i.e. Y flow  

> 1

∼ ρX whenever Y flow  

> 0

∼ N (0 , I). One sees that this corresponds exactly to the linear interpolant from Definition 5.1, i.e. It = (1 − t)Z + tX and 

b(t, x ) = E

h ˙It | It = x

i

= vflow (t, x )

for all (t, x ) ∈ [0 , 1] × Rd, where we used the notation b := bε≡0 for the ODE velocity of the linear interpolant from Definition 5.1. 

B.2. Diffusion models 

In a variance-preserving diffusion model (or more precisely a score-based generative model ) one corrupts data ˜Y0 = X ∼ ρX

into noise ˜Y∞ = Z ∼ N (0 , I) through an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process run from time 0 to ∞ (or some finite but large T in practice which introduces a bias), 

d ˜Ys = −f (s) ˜Ys ds + g(s) d ˜Ws,

19 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

with smooth and non-negative f, g satisfying 

Z ∞

> 0

f (s) d s =

Z ∞

> 0

g(s) d s = ∞,

so that the stationary distribution is indeed standard Gaussian, i.e. ˜Y∞ ∼ N (0 , I).One then uses Anderson’s time reversal (Anderson, 1982) to construct the unique reverse-time process run from ∞ (or T ) to 

0 that turns noise into data with the same joint distribution as the forward process. This reverse-time process depends on the score function of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with initial distribution ρX .To compare diffusion models to flow models and stochastic interpolants one must compactify time via some C1 monotonically increasing bijection ϕ : [0 , ∞) → [0 , 1) satisfying ϕ(0) = 0 and lim s→∞ ϕ(s) = 1 , with inverse ψ := ϕ−1 : [0 , 1) →

[0 , ∞). One can then define Yτ := ˜Yψ(τ ) for τ ∈ [0 , 1) , and by a limiting argument extend to τ ∈ [0 , 1] . Using similar standard stochastic calculus techniques as in the proof of Theorem 5.5 one gets that 

dYτ = −f (ψ(τ )) ψ′(τ ) Yτ dτ + g(ψ(τ )) pψ′(τ ) d Wτ ,

with 

Wτ := 

Z ψ(τ )0

pϕ′(s) d ˜Ws.

In particular, if we take ϕ(s) = 1 − exp( −s) so that ψ(τ ) = − log(1 − τ ) and ψ′(τ ) = 1 /(1 − τ ), we get the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process 

dYτ = − f (− log(1 − τ )) 1 − τ Yτ dτ + g(− log(1 − τ )) 

√1 − τ dWτ .

As the following Proposition B.5 shows, when one chooses the statistically optimal diffusion scale ε = ε∗ in the stochastic interpolant framework, the corresponding reverse-time SDE becomes an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the time range 

[0 , 1] . Before stating this result we need to introduce the backward drift as in (Albergo et al., 2025) as well as the core result analogous to Theorem 1.4 along with an intra-interpolant conversion result similar to Proposition 4.2. 

Definition B.2 (backward drift) . For an interpolant as in Definition 1.1 and ε : [0 , 1] → [0 , ∞], ε ∈ C1((0 , 1]) we define the backward drift ←

bε(t, x ) := ˙ αtηZ (t, x ) + ˙βtηX (t, x ) − εts(t, x ).

We refer the reader to Albergo et al. (2025) for a proof of the following result. 

Theorem B.3. Define τ := 1 − t and ←

Wτ := −Wτ = −W1−t. Then the solutions to the family of reverse-time SDEs

W , satisfy Law( ←

Xετ ) = Law( I1−τ ) for all τ ∈ [0 , 1] .

The following proposition can be proved analogously to Proposition 4.2. 

Proposition B.4. For a fixed interpolation schedule (α, β ) and ε : [0 , 1] → [0 , ∞), the backward drift from Definition B.2 can be expressed in terms of the score through the equation

bε(t, x ) = ( ε∗

for all (t, x ) ∈ (0 , 1) × Rd.

We now state and prove our own result. 20 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

Proposition B.5. Let ←

b∗ := 

> ←

bε∗

be the statistically optimal (in forward-time) reverse-time drift for any (non point mass) stochastic interpolant as per Definition 1.1. Then the associated reverse-time SDE from Theorem B.3 is a time-scaled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of the form

= 1 for all t ∈ [0 , 1] , then the reverse-time SDE reduces to

Proof. The SDE from Theorem B.3 reads

Using Proposition B.4 with ε = ε∗ gives

## C. Schedule visualizations 

The first row of Figure 4 visualizes the linear schedule (see Definition 5.1) used in flow matching models alongside the lazy ODE and SDE schedule, respectively (see Proposition 7.1 and in particular Example 7.4). The second row visualizes the statistically optimal diffusion scale ε∗ (see Definition 4.1 and Theorem 4.3) associated with each schedule. The figure uses the denominator definition dt := (1 − t)2 + t2. Note that these are the schedules and diffusion scales used in Figure 1.

## E. ODE and SDE numerical integration schemes 

Below we give numerical schemes for solving the SDE from Theorem 1.4 with drift bε and additive diffusion scale ε,

dXεt = bε(t, X εt ) d t + √2εt dWt.

With ε ≡ 0 the SDE degenerates to an ODE and e.g. the Euler-Maruyama scheme becomes the explicit Euler scheme. Note that the experiments either use ε ≡ 0 or ε = ε∗, and with the schedules we consider the quadratic variation from time s

to t (0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ 1) under the latter diffusion scale, R ts 2ε∗ 

> u

du, can be calculated analytically (see Proposition 7.1 and Proposition 5.2) and is therefore used in the below schemes and in our experiments. For a total of N > 1 solver steps we use a fixed step size of ∆t = 1 

> N

. We denote the solution after n ∈ { 0, 1, . . . , N }

steps by Yn at time tn = n∆t. For n < N the independent Wiener process increments from time tn to tn+1 are denoted 

∆Wn ∼ N (0 , ∆t I) and we define Vn := 

R tn+1  

> tn

2εt dt



∆Wn/∆t. With the “corrected” solution at time n denoted by ˜Yn

and initially defined as ˜Y0 := Y0 the update step from Yn to Yn+1 is then defined as below. 

Euler-Maruyama 

Yn+1 = Yn + ∆ tb ε(tn, Y n) + Vn.

Predictor-Corrector 

Yn+1 = ˜Yn + ∆ tb ε(tn, Y n) + Vn,

˜Yn+1 = ˜Yn + 12 ∆t(bε(tn, Y n) + bε(tn+1 , Y n+1 )) + Vn.

Heun 

Yn+1 = ˜Yn + ∆ tb ε(tn, ˜Yn) + Vn,

˜Yn+1 = ˜Yn + 12 ∆t(bε(tn, Y n) + bε(tn+1 , Y n+1 )) + Vn.

We use a variant of the predictor-corrector and Heun scheme in which the final, returned solution is YN so that the corrected final solution ˜YN is never computed. This prevents us from ever having to evaluate the drift bε at t = 1 .8

Note that the “correct” step for the predictor-corrector scheme is equivalent to the Heun scheme. They both use an Euler-Maruyama “predict” step and only differ in whether the drift in this step is evaluated in Yn or ˜Yn. This detail means that the Heun scheme uses two drift evaluations per step while the Euler-Maruyama and predictor-corrector schemes only use one. Since evaluating this drift function in practice amount to doing an expensive forward pass in a neural network the Heun scheme is therefore roughly twice as slow as it requires 2N − 1 function evaluations instead of N . To compare the three schemes fairly, we used half the amount of steps for the Heun scheme compared to the predictor-corrector and Euler-Maruyama schemes. For the PRX model and settings used in our experiments we find that the predictor-corrector scheme generally converges faster as a function of drift evaluations than the Euler-Maruyama and Heun scheme, especially for SDE generation. This is indicated by Figure 5 and Figure 6 which consider sample images generated with the standard linear flow model schedule using the ODE generation ( ε ≡ 0) and statistically optimal SDE generation ( ε = ε∗), respectively, for the same prompt “Two husky’s hanging out of the car windows”. One sees that the predictor-corrector scheme converges to the reference image at 4096 steps (at which the Heun scheme has used 2048 steps) slightly faster than the Euler-Maruyama and Heun scheme. All schemes more or less converge to the same reference image, as expected. Note that the choice of integration scheme is not important for our experiments since the purpose is not to investigate which scheme leads to better image generation (faster convergence) but rather to assess the effect of transforming to the lazy schedule whilst keeping the integration scheme fixed.      

> 8Evaluating the drift at t= 1 is in fact not a problem for us. The PRX flow model we use uses linear ODE velocity parameterization and no division by zero (which can potentially occur since α1= 0 ) is introduced in our conversion formulas from this linear velocity to the ODE velocities and SDE drifts we consider.

## F. Further experimental results 

F.1. Solver convergence animations 

The solver convergence is better visualized as an animation than as a static image. Figure 7 shows sample images for 5

prompts generated with 64 predictor-corrector solver steps. An animation over multiple solver steps is available at this Zenodo link. Heuristically, we find that after 64 steps the SDE solutions are comparable to the ODE solutions in fidelity, but this is of course a subjective matter.          

> Figure 7. Sample images generated using 64 predictor-corrector steps for 5different prompts from our experiment. Each row corresponds to whether an ODE or SDE is used and whether the original linear flow model schedule or the conversion to the lazy schedule is used. An animation over all solver step amounts {4,8, . . . , 4096 }is available at this Zenodo link.

F.2. Equivalence of convergence 

Here we test whether the ODE and SDE solutions converge to the same reference image irrespectively of whether the flow or lazy schedule is used. For each ni amount of solver steps we calculate the RMSE between the image generated with the original linear flow model schedule against the image generated with the conversion to the lazy one using ni steps, i.e. we calculate 

RMSE (img ODE,flow  

> ni

, img ODE,lazy  

> ni

)

for each i and similarly for the SDE. We then average over all 100 prompts and plot this average as a function of ni for the ODE and SDE, respectively. The result is shown in Figure 8. The figure indicates that both the ODE and SDE converge to 26 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

the same reference image irrespectively of which schedule is used, but this convergence is much faster for the ODE than for the SDE. This is probably due to the fact that the flow and lazy schedule are somewhat similar for ODE generation (in particular they both satisfy α0 = 1 ), while for SDE generation the lazy schedule is a point mass schedule (see Figure 4). Since the flow model velocity is not learned perfectly, approximation errors make the flow-to-lazy schedule transform inexact which amplifies more for SDE generation relative to ODE generation. 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096

By “within-step RMSE” we mean the RMSE between the image generated under the original linear flow model schedule versus that generated using the conversion to the lazy schedule for a fixed number of solver steps, for the ODE and SDE, respectively. Shaded area indicates a 95% confidence interval calculated by bootstrapping with 10 ,000 samples. The plot indicates that the RMSE converges to zero as the number of solver steps grows, as one would expect, although the convergence is much faster for the ODE than for the SDE.

However, Figure 9 shows that even with this disadvantage the lazy schedule converges statistically significantly faster most of the time. As one would 27 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants 

expect, the results are slightly worse, e.g. the lazy schedule is not statistically significantly better for SDE generation at 1024 

solver steps compared to the linear flow schedule, whereas when using the average reference as common reference it is (see Figure 3). 28 Fast Sampling for Flows and Diffusions with Lazy and Point Mass Stochastic Interpolants

# CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting 

Yaguo Liu 1 Mingyue Cheng 1 Daoyu Wang 1 Xiaoyu Tao 1 Qi Liu 1

## Abstract 

Time series forecasting can be viewed as a gener-ative problem that requires both semantic under-standing over contextual conditions and stochas-tic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either au-toregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like mod-els for continuous probabilistic generation. How-ever, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative frame-work that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series fore-casting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting en-coder–decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics con-ditioned on the autoregressively generated rep-resentation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally sup-ports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on mul-tiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consis-tently outperforms previous compared baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/ liuyaguo/_CoGenCast .

## 1. Introduction 

Time series forecasting supports a wide range of real-world decision-making processes, including energy (Zhou et al., 2024), finance (Feng et al., 2019) and healthcare (Cheng et al., 2024). The core philosophy of forecasting (Liu et al., 2023) is to predict future values conditioned on historical

observations, while future evolution is often full of complex-ity and uncertainty. To handle this, previous works typically implement a simple regression mapping (Nie et al., 2022). However, recently, an increasing number of methods employ more powerful mapping functions, such as LLMs (Niu et al., 2025; Jiang et al.) and diffusion-like (Guo et al., 2025) mod-els. These methods reformulate forecasting as a conditional generative problem (Wu et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024c). Current generative forecasting methods can be divided into two main categories: LLM-based methods and diffusion-like models. First, LLM-based methods leverage the strong semantic understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs. These can be further branched into tuning-based methods (Jin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), which finetune LLMs to align them with numerical time series modeling, and training-free methods (Liu et al., 2024b; Cheng et al., 2025c), which keep LLMs frozen and rely on prompting or reasoning mechanisms to perform forecasting. Second, diffusion-like models focus on modeling the probabilistic evolution of future time series in continuous-valued spaces. These approaches effectively capture uncertainty in future temporal trajectories. Representative works such as NsD-iff (Ye et al., 2025) and TSFlow (Kollovieh et al., 2024) learn continuous stochastic temporal dynamics, enabling high-quality probabilistic generation (Tashiro et al., 2021). Although the above generative forecasting methods achieve promising results, we argue that an ideal forecasting ap-proach should simultaneously possess dual capabilities: semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Tak-ing electricity load forecasting (Wang et al., 2024) as a concrete example, a model should achieve a deep under-standing of diverse contextual conditions, such as historical load patterns, urban population, and weather variables, to capture the underlying semantic dependencies. Meanwhile, future electricity demand is closely linked to unpredictable future weather shifts, holiday effects, and other uncertain factors (Rasul et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024b) requiring stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Building upon the analysis above, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series 1

forecasting. Specifically, we introduce a reconfiguration of pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting en-coder–decoder backbone. Instead of retraining LLMs from scratch, we modify only the attention topology to construct a bidirectional encoder for comprehensive understanding over contextual conditions and a causal decoder for autoregres-sive representation generation. A flow-matching denoising decoder is further integrated to model temporal evolution, effectively capturing continuous stochastic dynamics con-ditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, unlike conventional flow-matching methods, our approach targets the mean velocity field, enabling efficient one-step generation with low latency. As a result, CoGen-Cast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. CoGenCast outperforms previous compared baselines across multiple real-world benchmarks. We summarize our main contributions as follows: • We highlight that an ideal forecasting approach should possess dual capabilities: semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of con-tinuous temporal dynamics. • We propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative frame-work that couples pre-trained LLMs with continuous flow-matching mechanism for time series forecasting. • We conduct extensive experiments on multiple bench-marks, demonstrating that CoGenCast consistently out-performs previous compared baselines. 

## 2. Related Work 

2.1. LLM-based Time Series Forecasting 

Recently, LLM-based (Jin et al., 2024) methods become increasingly prevalent in time series forecasting due to the strong semantic understanding (Pan et al., 2024) and genera-tion (Bian et al., 2024) capabilities of LLMs. Existing LLM-based time series forecasting methods can be broadly cate-gorized into tuning-based and training-free methods. Within the tuning-based category, PromptCast (Xue & Salim, 2023) reformulates forecasting as a sentence-to-sentence task us-ing text prompts; Time-LLM (Jin et al., 2023) utilizes a learnable interface to reprogram continuous patches into the linguistic space; LLM4TS (Chang et al., 2025) combines the LLM’s feature extraction capabilities with a specialized lin-ear head for numerical output; TokenCast (Tao et al., 2025) implements symbolic discretization to map series into a uni-fied vocabulary for autoregressive generation; ChatTS (Xie et al., 2024) aligns time series as a standalone modality with LLMs via synthetic data to enable open-ended reasoning; and Time-R1 (Luo et al., 2025) feeds the entire sequence as a direct reasoning input while employing reinforcement learn-ing to optimize explicit slow-thinking chains. Conversely, within the training-free category, LLMTIME (Gruver et al., 2023) demonstrates the potential of pre-trained models to extrapolate numerical strings without further training, and TimeReasoner (Cheng et al., 2025c) induces multi-step tem-poral reasoning via multi-step prompting. 

2.2. Diffusion-like Time Series Forecasting 

Diffusion models become superior generative tools for time series forecasting due to their powerful capabilities of ef-fectively capturing temporal uncertainty. Early research primarily focused on foundational architectural adaptations: TimeGrad (Rasul et al., 2021) pioneers the integration of an autoregressive framework with denoising diffusion models, while CSDI (Tashiro et al., 2021) utilizes a non-autoregressive score-based model to capture spatio-temporal correlations. Subsequent studies shift toward condition-enhanced mechanisms to improve effectiveness: TimeD-iff (Shen & Kwok, 2023) introduces future mixup and au-toregressive initialization to strengthen pattern capture; Ns-Diff (Ye et al., 2025) incorporates a location-scale noise model for adaptive noise scheduling in non-stationary data; and DyDiff (Guo et al., 2025) improves forecasting perfor-mance by modeling temporal transitions within the diffusion process. To bridge the efficiency gap of iterative diffusion models, flow-matching models has emerged as its faster gen-eration. FlowTS (Hu et al., 2024) accelerates generation by learning straight-line transport paths via rectified flow, while TSFlow (Kollovieh et al., 2024) incorporates Gaussian pro-cess priors to align these trajectories with temporal dynam-ics. Additionally, FreqFlow (Moghadas et al., 2025) shifts the process into the frequency domain to capture long-term patterns. Despite these methods make significant progress, no single approach adequately satisfies the dual require-ments of semantic understanding and continuous stochastic modeling. To address this, we propose CoGenCast, a hy-brid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with continuous flow-matching mechanism for time series forecasting to model both aspects simultaneously. 

## 3. Methodology 

In this section, we provide the formal problem definition and present an overview of our proposed CoGenCast. We also detail the implementation process. 

3.1. Problem Formulation 

We consider the time series forecasting problem where the goal is to forecast future sequences based on histori-cal context features and numerical sequences (Cheng et al., 2025b). Let Xhist = {x1, . . . , x L} ∈ RL×D denote the look-back window of length L with D variables. The objective is to forecast the predicted window Xpred =

{xL+1 , . . . , x L+H } ∈ RH×D of length H. Additionally, 2CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting # Domain: Energy

Figure 1. Overview of our proposed CoGenCast. Left (Training): We reconfigure decoder-only LLMs into an encoder–decoder backbone by attention-only modification, and perform continuous flow-matching mechanism conditioned on the LLM-generated representation. 

Right (Inference): Future patches are generated autoregressively and sampled via one-step flow-matching generation with low-latency. 

let C denote the context features (e.g., domain knowledge, task instruction,statistics information). The problem (Cheng et al., 2025a) is formulated as learning the conditional prob-ability distribution P (Xpred | Xhist , C).

3.2. Framework Overview 

We propose a hybrid generative framework to model the conditional probability distribution P (Xpred | Xhist , C) by coupling pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism. We first reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology. Specifically, we initialize the LLM encoder by reusing the pre-trained decoder parameters while replacing causal self-attention with bidirectional self-attention. The LLM decoder keeps causal self-attention to preserve temporal causality, and introduces a newly added cross-attention that queries the encoder hidden states as keys and values. To capture stochastic continuous dynamics with the causal representation generation, we incorporate a continuous flow-matching mechanism conditioned on the LLM-generated representation. Specifically, we define a probability path and train a flow-matching denoising de-coder to predict the corresponding temporal velocity field. Moreover, by learning an interval-conditioned average ve-locity, the temporal evolution can approximate the entire transport process within a single step, which enables effi-cient sampling without iterative denoising. During infer-ence, each patch is produced autoregressively and sampled efficiently via one-step generation with low-latency. 

3.3. Coupled Training Autoregressive Language Encoder-Decoder. We first train the backbone to perform autoregressive encoder– decoder generation, producing semantically grounded and causal representations that serve as conditions for subse-quent continuous flow-matching mechanism. Unlike con-ventional decoder-only LLMs that rely solely on causal attention, time series forecasting requires both bidirectional understanding and causal generation. To meet these two re-quirements, we reconfigure decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology: the encoder adopts bidirectional self-attention to fuse the look-back window and context features, while the decoder preserves causal self-attention to gener-ate future representations autoregressively. Given context features C , we obtain text embeddings henc in text ∈ RM ×Dmodel 

using the LLM’s native tokenizer and embedding layer. In parallel, the look-back window Xhist ∈ RL×D is partitioned into N = L/P non-overlapping patches x1: N , and pro-jected into the same latent dimension Dmodel via a learnable linear layer to yield historical patch embeddings henc in  

> 1: N

. We then concatenate the text and patch embeddings along the sequence dimension and feed them into the bidirectional encoder to obtain fused contextual states henc out :

into patches y1: N and map them into latent embeddings 3CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting 

z1: N . To align with autoregressive training and ensure strict causality, we employ a shifted-input strategy by prepend-ing a learnable begin-of-sequence (BOS) embedding and excluding the final patch embedding zdec in  

> 1: N

:

zdec in  

> 1: N

= Concat (BOS , z1: N −1). (2) The shifted embeddings are then fed into the causal decoder, which combines (i) causal self-attention to model temporal dependencies without look-ahead and (ii) cross-attention over henc out to incorporate multimodal historical context. The resulting autoregressive states zdec out  

> 1: N

are: 

zdec out  

> 1: N

= Decoder (zdec in  

> 1: N

, henc out ). (3) Notably, each zdec out  

> j

is computed under a strict causal mask and summarizes information only from y1: j−1 together with the encoded history, making it a valid autoregressive repre-sentation for step-j forecasting. These hidden states condi-tion the subsequent continuous flow-matching mechanism, enabling the overall framework to jointly model semantic understanding and continuous stochastic dynamics. 

Continuous Flow-Matching Mechanism. In contrast to standard diffusion (Wang & He, 2025; Chen et al., 2024) or flow-matching methods (Geng et al., 2025a;b; Lu et al., 2025; 2026) that estimate an instantaneous vector field at a single time point, our formulation explicitly models the average velocity over a finite time interval. By learn-ing the dynamics across an integration window, the model can capture trajectory curvature more effectively, enabling high-quality generation with substantially fewer sampling steps. To construct a probability path that transports sam-ples from a source distribution to the target distribution, we adopt a direct linear interpolation between the clean future patches y1: N and Gaussian noise ϵ ∼ N (0 , I). For any time 

t ∈ [0 , 1] , the intermediate noisy state ˆy1: N is defined as a convex combination of signal and noise: 

ˆy1: N = (1 − t)ϵ + ty1: N . (4) Here, t = 0 corresponds to pure noise, while t = 1 recovers the clean patches. Geometrically, this linear interpolation induces a straight-line trajectory in data space, characterized by a constant base velocity direction v:

v = y1: N − ϵ. (5) This constant-velocity property substantially simplifies the underlying flow dynamics and provides a principled basis for high-quality few-step (and even one-step) generative modeling. We first project the interpolated noisy patches into the latent space using a linear projection layer, yielding the noised embeddings ˆzin  

> 1: N

. The denoising decoder strictly enforces the autoregressive constraint through a alignment strategy: the noised embeddings ˆzin  

> 1: N

are used as queries, while the conditional hidden states zdec out  

> 1: N

are used as keys and values. Notably, due to the shifted-input mechanism in the backbone, each context state zdec out  

> j

has already ag-gregated information from preceding clean patches y1: j−1.Unlike conventional flow matching, our estimator is condi-tioned not only on the current time t but also on a target step 

r (with r > t ), enabling the model to explicitly perceive the integration interval length. The velocity prediction for the 

j-th patch is thus formulated as: 

uout  

> j

= DenoisingDecoder (ˆ zin  

> j

, t, r, zdec out  

> 1: j

), (6) where the denoising decoder serves as a velocity estimator. This formulation ensures that the predicted velocity uout 

> j

depends only on the noised embedding ˆzin  

> j

, the interval [t, r ],and the available autoregressive context zdec out  

> 1: j

, thereby preventing any information leakage from future positions. 

Optimization Objective. To explicitly guide the model to learn the average velocity along the temporal trajectory, we employ a Jacobian-Vector Product (JVP) corrected opti-mization objective. During training, we sample the current time step t ∼ U [0 , 1] and a target time step r ∼ U [t, 1] .To approximate the true average velocity required to span the interval [t, r ], we apply a first-order Taylor expansion correction using the gradient of the velocity field. The final objective minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted velocity u and the JVP-corrected target. For-mally, the loss function is expressed as:

denotes the time partial derivative of the velocity field, which is efficiently computed via JVP. Minimizing this objective explicitly penalizes velocity variations, thereby compelling the model to learn straight temporal trajectories. 

3.4. One-step Inference Autoregressive Patch Generation. As illustrated in Fig-ure 1 (Right), inference proceeds iteratively in an autoregres-sive manner. For generating the j-th patch, the previously generated patches ˆy1: j−1 are first appended to the predicted window, which initiates with the BOS token. This sequen-tial appending serves to update the conditional keys and values used by the decoder, effectively capturing the causal dependencies between continuous temporal intervals. Un-like traditional point-regression models, our autoregressive appending maintains global semantic coherence by lever-aging the hidden states of previously generated patches as contextual conditions for the subsequent generation step. 4CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting 

One-step Generative Modeling. Within each autoregres-sive step, we initiate the generation of the j-th patch by sampling a pure Gaussian noise patch y(0)  

> j

∼ N (0 , I) (la-beled as y(0) in Figure 1). This noise patch is projected into the latent space via a linear layer to obtain the noisy repre-sentation z(0)  

> j

. Given the current noisy representation and the available autoregressive context, the denoising decoder functions as a velocity estimator and predicts the interval-conditioned patch-level velocity field. Notably, by learning an interval-conditioned average velocity, the transport pro-cess can approximate the entire transformation from noise (t = 0 ) to clean prediction ( t = 1 ) within a single step, which enables efficient sampling without iterative denois-ing. The output yout

is then recovered by integrating the predicted velocity over the time interval as shown in Eq. (8):

and is appended to the predicted window to form ˆy1: j , which will be used as the input context for the next autoregressive inference step. Notably, this one-step generation, corre-sponding to a single function evaluation, reduces inference latency while maintaining high-performance forecasting. 

## 4. Experiments 

In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed CoGenCast on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we perform extensive ablation studies and exploration analysis. 

4.1. Experimental Setup Datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, specifically including Energy (Liu et al., 2024a), ETT (4 subsets) (Zhou et al., 2021), Environment (abbreviated as Environ.) (Liu et al., 2024a), Exchange (Wu et al., 2021), Health (Liu et al., 2024a), Wind (Li et al., 2022), and Solar (Lai et al., 2018). Detailed statistics are summarized in Table 1. To clearly illustrate the practical scenarios and scale of these datasets, the table provides an overview of each dataset’s domain, the number of samples, and the number of variables per sample. A more compre-hensive description can be found in Appendix A. 

Baselines. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we com-pare our method with eight representative baselines span-ning three major categories. First, for LLM-based meth-ods, we select LLM4TS (Chang et al., 2025), which fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM using multi-scale temporal encod-ing, and Time-LLM (Jin et al., 2023), which reprograms frozen LLMs to align time series data with textual proto-types. Second, we select generative-based methods such

FlowTS constructs a con-tinuous probability path using flow-matching, CDPM em-ploys conditional diffusion probabilistic models, and CSDI uses a conditional score-based diffusion process to model the data distribution. Third, we compare with transformer-based methods, including TimeDART (Wang et al., 2024), PatchTST (Nie et al., 2022) and Autoformer (Wu et al., 2021). Further details are provided in Appendix B.1. 

Implementation Details. In the experiments, for all datasets, we set the look-back window length to L = 96 and the predicted window length with H ∈ { 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 }. We report two widely used forecasting metrics: mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Our backbone architecture is initialized with the pre-trained Qwen3-0.6B model parameters for both the encoder and decoder. For the continuous flow-matching mechanism, we adopt a lin-ear noise scheduler, which naturally matches our straight-trajectory formulation and enables efficient one-step sam-pling at inference time. A more comprehensive implemen-tation details can be found in Appendix B.2. 

4.2. Main Results 

Table 2 summarizes the main forecasting results across ten real-world benchmarks datasets. Overall, CoGenCast achieves the consistent and competitive performance, deliv-ering the best results across most datasets, which demon-strates strong generation capability across diverse domains. In particular, our approach outperforms representative LLM-based baselines (LLM4TS and Time-LLM), as well as strong generative-based and transformer-based methods, suggesting that effective forecasting benefits from simul-taneously capturing semantic understanding and continuous stochastic dynamics. On average, we observe an approxi-mate 11% reduction in MSE compared to LLM-based ap-proaches and over 7% improvement over strong transformer-5CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting

based baselines (e.g., PatchTST), indicating that the gains stem from a coupled modeling of both structural depen-dencies and temporal dynamics rather than architectural scaling alone. In summary, CoGenCast delivers state-of-the-art results with high consistency. This advantage is en-abled by structurally reconfiguring pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone via attention topology modification, and further integrating a flow-matching generative mechanism to model continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on autoregressively gener-ated representations. In addition to the in-domain evaluation in Table 2, we further conduct a general cross-domain train-ing setting to strengthen the generalization capability of our framework. As shown in Figure 2, cross-domain training leads to consistent performance improvements compared to training within a single domain, reducing MSE across mul-tiple datasets (e.g., Energy, Environ., ETTm1, and ETTh1).

4.3. Ablation Study Encoder-Decoder Variants. To verify the effectiveness of our encoder-decoder architecture, we conduct experi-ments with encoder-decoder variants. For the encoder-only variant, we retain the former encoder and add a linear layer at the end of the model. For the decoder-only variant, we retain the latter decoder and the denoising decoder. As shown in Table 3, the full encoder-decoder architecture achieves superior results compared to both variants on all datasets. Notably, the significant performance degradation in the decoder-only variant underscores the critical role of the encoder in providing semantic conditioning for the gen-erative process. Meanwhile, the performance gap between the full architecture and the encoder-only variant verifies that integrating flow matching into the autoregressive op-timization captures continuous dynamics more effectively than a linear layer. Overall, these results confirm that com-bining bidirectional context modeling in the encoder with causal representation generation in the decoder is necessary, and the proposed encoder–decoder architecture is essential to achieve the superior forecasting performance.

toregressive mechanism and the flow-matching mechanism. We compare the full model with three variants: w/o AR, w/o Flow and w/o AR-Flow. The results clearly show that removing either component leads to a significant degrada-tion in forecasting accuracy. Specifically, the w/o AR vari-ant exhibits a substantial increase in MSE, confirming that LLM-based semantic understanding is crucial for capturing long-term contextual dependencies. Simultaneously, the w/o Flow variant performs worse than the full model, vali-dating that the flow-matching mechanism effectively models the continuous temporal dynamics in time series data. Ul-timately, the full model achieves the best performance by successfully coupling these two methods. 

Ablation on Context Features. As shown in Figure 3, to investigate the impact of specific context features on fore-casting performance, we conduct a detailed ablation study. The considered variants include removing the entire textual input (w/o Text), as well as selectively excluding domain knowledge (w/o Domain), task instruction (w/o Instruction), and statistics information (w/o Statistics). The results indi-cate that the complete text-guided framework consistently yields the best performance. This confirms that the incor-poration of context features provides essential guidance, effectively enhancing forecasting accuracy. Notably, remov-ing the statistics information generally leads to a more pro-nounced error increase compared to other sub-components, further confirming its effectiveness and necessity.

4.4. Comparison with Generative Models Comparison with Generative Models. To further evalu-ate the architectural advantages of our approach, we conduct a comparative study by replacing our generation module with vanilla diffusion and flow-matching components within the identical framework. As demonstrated in Table 5, our method achieves superior forecasting performance across all benchmarks. This advantage is primarily attributed to the fundamental differences in modeling objectives. While diffusion models rely on complex iterative denoising to re-cover signals and standard flow-matching models targets instantaneous velocity, our method explicitly models the average velocity connecting the prior to the ground truth. 

Efficiency-Performance Trade-off. As shown in Fig-ure 4, we investigate the impact of the number of function evaluations (NFE) on forecasting performances. Remark-ably, one-step (1-NFE) generation achieves performance parity with the optimal 2-NFE, whereas extending the infer-ence to 3-NFE results in slight marginal degradation. This confirms that our learned temporal trajectories are nearly lin-ear, making a single Euler step sufficient for high-precision generation. Additional steps become redundant and prone to numerical error accumulation. Therefore, we adopt 1-NFE to achieve the best trade-off, ensuring real-time inference speed without compromising performance.

sensitivity to this hyperparameter. Notably, neither an overly small nor an excessively large patch size is desirable. This is attributed to the fact that the former fails to capture sufficient local semantic context, while the latter risks smoothing out fine-grained temporal dynamics. Thus, selecting a suitable patch size is essential to the forecasting performance. 

Noise Scheduler. We investigate the impact of different noise scheduler strategies on forecasting performance, com-paring linear and cosine schedulers. As shown in Figure 5, the linear scheduler yields superior results across most datasets. This is attributed to the linear scheduler offering uniform discretization that perfectly aligns with our average velocity modeling, which implies a straight constant-speed trajectory. Crucially, this alignment is significantly more suitable for our one-step generation modeling, as it ensures precise inference in a single step without the unnecessary temporal curvature introduced by the cosine scheduler. 

4.6. Analysis Experiment LLM Backbone. To verify the effectiveness of the back-bone architecture, we conduct a comparative analysis be-tween a vanilla Transformer and the Qwen LLM family across different parameter scales, as shown in Table 6. The results demonstrate that LLM-based backbones significantly outperform the vanilla Transformer backbone. This is at-tributed to the LLMs’ stronger fitting capability and the integration of multi-modal context features, which provide deeper semantic understanding to explicitly condition the generation process. Notably, comparing within the Qwen family, the Qwen3-4B model achieves the best performance. 12 24 36 48 0

Figure 6. Forecasting with uncertainty on four datasets. The plots compare the ground truth trajectories with the model’s mean predictions, along with the 50% and 80% predictive intervals. 

However, the performance gap between the 0.6B and 4B models is marginal. Considering the comprehensive trade-off between computational resources, training time, and forecasting performance, we selected Qwen3-0.6B as our default backbone, as it delivers performance approaching SOTA levels with significantly higher efficiency. 

Generative Uncertainty. To validate the uncertainty mod-eling capabilities of our framework, we visualize the differ-ent predictive distributions in Figure 6. The results demon-strate that our method generates forecasting distributions that closely align with the ground truth, with the 50% and 80% confidence intervals effectively encompassing the in-herent data variability. This high degree of overlap clearly indicates that our model provides not only precise point estimates but also well-calibrated uncertainty quantification. Such reliability suggests that our approach excels at captur-ing the stochastic nature of time series, offering significant practical potential for uncertainty-aware forecasting. 

## 5. Conclusion 

In this paper, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid genera-tive framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. This bridges the critical gap between semantic understand-ing and continuous stochastic modeling. By reconfiguring pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone, we leverage the comprehensive contextual understanding to condition the flow-matching generation process. Our approach linearizes the generative dynamics, establishing a direct and stable temporal trajec-tory that can be solved efficiently with a single function eval-uation. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines, confirming its effectiveness. Finally, we hope that this work offers a valuable and inspiring per-spective for future time series forecasting methods. 8CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting

## B. Implementation Details 

B.1. Compared Baselines 

To more comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of our proposed method, we compare our method with eight representative baselines in our experiments. Specifically, we include LLM-based approaches (LLM4TS and Time-LLM), generative-based models (FlowTS, CDPM, and CSDI), and transformer-based methods (TimeDART, PatchTST, and Autoformer). 12 CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting 

LLM4TS (Chang et al., 2025) LLM4TS 1 is a framework that adapts pre-trained LLMs for time series forecasting via two-stage fine-tuning (time-series alignment and downstream forecasting) and a two-level multi-scale temporal aggregation mechanism, enabling LLMs to better capture time series characteristics and multi-resolution patterns, especially in data-scarce settings.

B.2. Implementation Details for Experiment 

The look-back window length of L = 96 and the predicted window lengths H ∈ { 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 } were applied to all datasets. To ensure consistency, a batch size of 4 and a channel-independent configuration were applied across all datasets. We employed the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate selected from {5 × 10 −4, 10 −4, 5 × 10 −5} . The training process was conducted for 10 epochs. We adopted Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as our primary evaluation metrics. All baseline methods were evaluated using their respective official implementations to ensure a fair comparison. The entire framework was implemented in PyTorch and executed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

## D. Ablation Study Full Results 

D.1. Encoder-Decoder Variants 

As shown in Table 10, to validate the architectural design of our framework, we performed a comparative analysis between the complete encoder-decoder model and its two primary variants: Encoder-only and Decoder-only architectures, implemented with varying model sizes (0.6B and 1.7B). As presented in the ablation results, the full architecture yields superior forecasting accuracy across most benchmark datasets. The Decoder-only variants exhibit significant performance degradation, particularly on datasets with complex temporal patterns such as Health and Wind. This substantial drop in performance confirms that the bidirectional encoder is essential for capturing deep semantic representations and historical context, which are critical for effective time series forecasting. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the performance advantage of our proposed architecture is not merely a result of increased parameter count. Experiments prove that our full model consistently outperforms the Encoder-only variant, even when the latter is scaled to a significantly larger 1.7B backbone. This demonstrates that the structural synergy between bidirectional contextual understanding and causal generative refinement is the primary driver of our model’s effectiveness, offering consistent improvements. 

D.2. Ablation on AR-Flow 

As shown in Table 11, to investigate the individual contributions of the two core generative components, we conducted a granular ablation study across all ten benchmarks by comparing the full framework with three restricted variants: w/o AR, which removes the bidirectional encoding and causal generation backbone; w/o Flow, which replaces the continuous flow-matching process with a deterministic output; and w/o AR-Flow, representing a baseline without either advancement. As shown in the ablation results, the full model consistently achieves superior precision, while the removal of either module leads to a noticeable performance decay across varying horizons. Specifically, the w/o AR variant exhibits a marked increase in both MSE and MAE, confirming that the LLM-based semantic reasoning and structural prior are fundamental for capturing complex, long-range temporal dependencies. Simultaneously, the w/o Flow variant yields inferior results compared to the full model, validating that the continuous flow-matching module is essential for effectively modeling the stochasticity and fine-grained dynamics in continuous-valued time series. The significant degradation observed in the w/o AR-Flow variant further underscores that the synergy between discrete semantic coupling and linearized continuous generation is the primary driver of our model’s superior forecasting stability. 

D.3. Ablation on Context Features 

As shown in Table 12, to evaluate the specific contributions of various textual context components, we conducted a comprehensive ablation study across ten benchmarks by selectively removing domain knowledge, task instruction, and statistics information. As illustrated in the results, the full text-conditioned framework consistently achieves the best performance across all datasets and prediction horizons. Specifically, removing the entire textual input (w/o Text) leads to a universal degradation in forecasting precision, confirming that semantic context provides essential guidance for the generative process. Among the individual sub-components, the exclusion of statistics information (w/o Statistics) frequently results in a more pronounced increase in error compared to omitting domain features or instructions, as seen in datasets like Energy and Exchange. This suggests that explicit statistical metadata—such as mean and variance—is critical for the model to effectively align its generative distribution with the global data scale. Furthermore, the performance drop observed in the w/o Domain and w/o Instruction variants validates that high-level task descriptions and domain-specific knowledge further refine the model’s understanding capability, enabling more accurate capture of diverse temporal patterns. These results empirically verify that a multi-faceted semantic conditioning strategy is vital for high-precision time series forecasting. 

## E. Comparison with Generative Models 

As shown in Table 13, to verify the architectural advantages of our framework, we conducted a comprehensive comparison against two mainstream generative paradigms: vanilla flow-matching and diffusion models. As evidenced by the results across ten diverse benchmarks, our method consistently secures superior forecasting performance across all prediction horizons. Specifically, our model achieves a marked reduction in error metrics compared to Diffusion-based approaches, which often suffer from error accumulation during iterative denoising steps. Furthermore, our approach outperforms standard Flow-matching baselines by a significant margin, particularly on datasets with high volatility. This performance gap highlights the efficacy of our modeling objective, which explicitly targets a linearized generative path, thereby stabilizing 14 CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting 

the generation process and effectively bridging high-level semantic understanding with continuous probabilistic modeling. As shown in Table 14, complementing this comparative analysis, we further examined the computational efficiency and stability of our generative process through an ablation study on the number of function evaluations (NFE). While traditional generative models typically require multiple sampling steps to ensure output fidelity, our results demonstrate that our framework achieves optimal or near-optimal forecasting accuracy with just a single evaluation step. Increasing the sampling steps to two or three yields only marginal performance gains in specific cases, while the one-step inference remains highly accurate across all datasets. This finding empirically confirms the straightness of the learned flow trajectories, proving that our linearized coupling strategy enables rapid, high-precision inference without the latency and computational overhead inherent in multi-step iterative solvers. 

## F. Hyperparameter Sensitivity 

F.1. Patch Size 

As shown in Table 16, to investigate the impact of local temporal granularity on forecasting performance, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying the patch size within the range of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. As illustrated in the results, our model demonstrates varying degrees of sensitivity to this hyperparameter across different datasets, with intermediate patch sizes of 4 and 6 generally yielding the optimal balance between local detail and global structure. For instance, datasets such as ETTh1, and Energy achieve their lowest errors with these settings. However, distinct patterns emerge for specific domains; the Environment and Exchange datasets favor a smaller patch size of 2, suggesting that these time series benefit from a higher-resolution tokenization to capture rapid, fine-grained fluctuations. Conversely, adopting an excessively large patch size (e.g., 10) consistently leads to performance degradation, most notably in the Health benchmark where the error significantly increases compared to the optimal setting. This deterioration likely stems from the smoothing effect of large patches, which obscures critical short-term dynamics required for accurate generation. Similarly, while small patches benefit specific domains, they prove suboptimal for complex systems like Health and Wind, where insufficient semantic context per token hampers the model’s understanding capabilities. These findings confirm that selecting an appropriate patch size is essential for effectively tokenizing continuous time series into semantically meaningful units. 

F.2. Noise Scheduler Analysis 

As shown in Table 15, to investigate the impact of different noise scheduler strategies on forecasting performance, we conducted a comparative analysis between the linear scheduler and the cosine scheduler across ten real-world benchmarks. As illustrated in the results, the linear scheduler consistently yields superior results in terms of both MSE and MAE across almost all datasets. The superiority of the linear scheduler can be attributed to its uniform discretization, which perfectly aligns with our average velocity modeling objective that implies a constant-speed generative trajectory. Unlike the cosine scheduler, which introduces unnecessary temporal curvature, the linear scheduler ensures a straighter mapping that is more suitable for our one-step generation modeling, enabling precise inference in a single step without compromising accuracy. Consequently, we adopt the linear noise scheduler as our default configuration to maintain optimal forecasting precision. 

## G. Analysis Experiment 

G.1. LLM Backbone 

As shown in Table 17, to assess the impact of backbone architecture and parameter scale on forecasting fidelity, we conducted a comparative analysis between a vanilla Transformer and the Qwen LLM family across varying scales of 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. As evidenced in the results, all LLM-based variants significantly outperform the vanilla transformer across all benchmarks. This performance leap is primarily attributed to the superior representational capacity of LLMs and their ability to integrate contextual conditions, which provide a strong semantic understanding for conditioning the generation process. Within the Qwen family, while the Qwen3-4B model generally yields the lowest error metrics, the performance gap between the 4B model and the smaller 0.6B and 1.7B variants is often marginal. For instance, on datasets such as Exchange and ETTm1, the 0.6B model achieves results comparable to its larger counterparts. These findings suggest that for time series forecasting, the architectural advantages of a pre-trained LLM are effectively realized even at a compact scale. Consequently, balancing computational overhead, training latency, and predictive accuracy, we select Qwen3-0.6B as our default backbone, as it delivers performance approaching state-of-the-art levels with significantly higher inference efficiency. 15 CoGenCast: A Coupled Autoregressive–Flow Generative Framework for Time Series Forecasting 

G.2. Extended-Length Look-back Window 

As shown in Table 18, our framework is designed to support variable-length look-back windows without structural modifications. To validate this capability and evaluate the ability of the model to leverage long-term historical context, we investigated the impact of extending the look-back window size L from 96 to 192 and 336 across all ten benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate that increasing the look-back window leads to progressive improvements in forecasting accuracy. Notably, on datasets with rich temporal dependencies like ETTh1 and Energy, extending the history from 96 to 336 steps results in a stable reduction in both MSE and MAE across all prediction horizons. This trend confirms that our model effectively utilizes the extended context to capture complex, long-range dependencies. The stable performance at 

L = 336 further indicates that our hybrid generative architecture successfully aligns global historical patterns with local stochastic dynamics, maintaining high-precision trajectories even when processing significantly longer input sequences. 

## H. Visualization Energy Health ETTh1 ETTm1 

GroundTruth Ours TimeLLM CDPM PatchTST  

> Figure 7. Comparison of forecasting results on Energy, Health, ETTh1, and ETTm1 datasets. We visualize the predicted trajectories of our method against the ground truth and leading baselines (Time-LLM, CDPM, and PatchTST).

To provide a qualitative assessment of forecasting fidelity, we visualize the predicted trajectories of our framework alongside the ground truth and competitive baselines, including Time-LLM, CDPM, and PatchTST. As illustrated in Figure 7, our model consistently generates future sequences that align most closely with the ground truth across diverse datasets such as Energy, Health, and the ETT series. Specifically, in datasets characterized by high volatility and complex seasonal patterns like Health, our model effectively captures the underlying stochastic dynamics without the severe over-smoothing or spurious fluctuations observed in baseline methods. Furthermore, for the ETTh1 and ETTm1 benchmarks, while competing methods often exhibit significant distributional shifts or phase delays, our approach maintains a stable and precise trend. This demonstrates the capability of our hybrid generative framework to bridge global semantic understanding with local continuous refinement. These visualized results empirically confirm that our model not only achieves superior numerical performance but also produces reliable and physically meaningful forecasts for real-world time series applications.

Abstract —This work presents the tunable generation of vortex, vector, and flat-top 1060-nm NIR beams in a few-mode fiber with a mechanical long-period fiber grating. By the variation of applied force on the fiber grating, the core mode to higher-order mode excitation can be adjusted. The manipulation of the beam transformation is achieved through the polarization control of the fiber eigenmodes and mode coupling efficiency. By precisely tuning the intensity ratio between fundamental and doughnut modes, we arrive at the generation of propagation-invariant vector flat-top beams for more than 5 m. Transverse optical field of 532-nm green light from frequency-doubled Nd-doped yttrium vanadate laser is manipulated and coupled into various intensity distributions in a few-mode fiber by using a mechanically induced long-period fiber grating. We show that the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam can be generated from the input Gaussian beam via the coupling of the fundamental core mode to a series of co-propagating higher-order modes with properly applied forces and polarizations.

I. INTRODUCTION 

HE structured light beams refer to customized light fields where the spatial and temporal properties of optical waves are precisely tailored rather than uniform. Unlike conventional Gaussian beams or plane waves, structured light allows for non-uniform distributions of amplitude, phase, or polarization, which provide various potential scientific and technical applications. Among the numerous categories of structured light beams, vector, vortex, and flat-top beams have attracted intensive attentions in the past two decades. 

The vector beam refers to the light with non-uniform transverse polarization distributions. One kind of vector beams is a light beam whose polarization state is axially symmetric in the cross section, i.e., a cylindrical vector beam (CVB) [1]. The CVB is the characteristic solution of the paraxial Helmholtz equation in the cylindrical coordinate system. The polarization state of the CVB is indeterminate on the propagation axis, where polarization singularity and intensity singularity exist. Among the various unconventional optical beams, the optical vortex beam (OVB) is another kind which carries non-zero orbital angular momentum (OAM) and is characterized by

phase singularity and intensity singularity on the density profile of the optical field [2]. When a spiral phase is added to the vector beam, the beam will acquire an OAM and is termed as a vector vortex beam (VVB). In their lowest orders, these beams (CVB, OVB, and VVB) are usually characterized by doughnut-shaped beam profiles, and various applications have been found, such as laser machining, particle acceleration, surface plasmon excitation, optical information processing, optical trapping and manipulation, atom-guiding by non-diffracting beams, and super-spatial-resolution microscopy, etc., leading to a revolution in optical manipulation [3]–[5]. 

Typical methods for doughnut beam generation use bulk optical devices, but they usually encounter stability issues. For example, the generation of CVB can be carried out by interference, spatial light modulator (SLM) wavefront reconstruction, and crystal birefringence. However, these methods require free-space optical systems, which are costly and depend on precise optical alignments. The entire system is bulky and its stability is easily influenced by the environment. Alternatively, it is demonstrated that an offset coupling between a single-mode fiber (SMF) and a multi-mode fiber allows the generation of radially, azimuthally, or hybridly polarized light beams, but the coupling loss is usually large [6]. 

The generation of flat-top beams with nearly uniform intensity distribution through the Gaussian beam conversion [1-3] has many applications, such as laser materials processing, lithography, medical surgery, and information security. However, the kind of beams are not eigenmodes of free space and would dramatically change their intensity profiles and diverge rapidly during propagation [4-6]. The progress to overcome this drawback has been achieved with vector flat-top beams and low numerical aperture illumination technique [7]. For this reason, the vector flat-top beams have inspired a variety of generation methods, for example, the realization of spatially stationary partially coherent fields by producing incoherent mixtures of plane waves using planar primary sources [8] or by conical refraction of biaxial crystals [9]. Recently, the exploitation of the polarization-dependent efficiency of spatial light modulators has also successfully realized the vector flat-top beam in the superposition of a Gaussian beam and a vortex beam [10]. However, the nonuniformity in the beam profile may be inevitable since the beam focusing and alignment in this

free-space architecture are subtle. 

Both theoretical and experimental studies have confirmed the existence of vector, vortex, or vector vortex beams [1,2]. Numerous applications have been found, such as laser machining, particle acceleration, surface plasmon excitation, optical information processing, optical trapping and manipulation, atom-guiding by non-diffracting beams, and super-spatial-resolution microscopy, etc., leading to arevolution in optical science and technology. In their lowest orders, these beams are usually characterized by doughnut-shaped intensity profiles. Based on the coupling of the fundamental core mode to a series of co-propagating higher-order core modes, long-period fiber gratings (LPGs) are suitable as an all-fiber device for the mode conversion and the generation of cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) or orbital angular momentums (OAMs) [3-5]. 

This work presents the possibility of tunable generation of vortex, vector, and flat-top beams using the combination of single-mode fiber (SMF) and few-mode fiber (FMF) optical system. With the variation of applied force on the long-period fiber grating (LPG), the core mode to higher-order mode excitation can be adjusted. Eventually, the manipulation of the beam transformation is achieved through the polarization control of the fiber eigenmodes and mode coupling efficiency. By precisely tuning the coupling ratio between the fundamental and doughnut modes, we arrive at the generation of propagation-invariant vector flat-top beams for more than 5 m, which is much longer than the flat-top beams generated in other proposed architectures. 

Previously, by using a constant-period V-grooved plate and a flat plate, we have made ultrabroadband LPGs with 3-dB bandwidth of 415 nm in a two-mode fiber upon which the mechanical stress gradient is employed [5]. The mechanically induced LPG mode converter is versatile, and are used to obtain the vector beams and the vortex beams in the 1.06-μm spectral band. A flat-top beam has also been generated by controlling the coupling efficiency between the fundamental and higher-order modes. In this work, we show that in addition to the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam and the crater-lake beam can also be generated in the 532-nm visible band with a mechanically induced few-mode LPG via the coupling of the fundamental core mode to a series of co-propagating higher-order modes. 

II. E XPERIMENTAL SETUP 

Based on the mechanically induced LPG, Fig. 1. depicts the experimental setup of the optical fiber system for generating vortex beams, vector beams, and flat-top beams. An ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier (YDFA) is used as the gain medium of an ytterbium-doped fiber laser (YDFL). The output port of YDFA is connected to the input port through an output coupler, an in-line polarizer, and a tunable filter, thus forming a wavelength-tunable ring-cavity fiber laser. An FMF for the 1-μm spectral 

band is sandwiched between a periodical V-grooved plate and a flat plate, on which the force is applied to produce quasi-periodic stress on the FMF. As a force gradient is properly introduced along the fiber, the light from YDFL is launched into the SMF and efficiently coupled into the FMF with a fusion splice. The SMF used for the 1-μm spectral band is Corning HI 1060. The cutoff wavelength of the fundamental mode for SMF-28 is about 1260 nm, which means that SMF-28 is a two-mode fiber in the 1-μm band, supporting LP 01 and LP 11 modes. Through tuning the polarization controllers, the input LP 01 fundamental mode from the SMF is coupled to the LP 11 modes in the FMF by the mechanically induced LPG. Then, an optical doughnut of a vortex beam or a vector beam can be generated by tuning the polarization controllers (PCs). By tuning the coupling between the fundamental and doughnut beams, we can also realize a propagation-invariant flat-top beam. Finally, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is exploited to verify the phase information of the vortex beam. 

A schematic diagram of visible light mode tuning based on the mechanically induced LPG is shown in Fig. 2, in which a Corning HI1060 few-mode fiber (FMF) is sandwiched between a V-grooved plate having a period of 400 μm and a flat plate, where the force gradient is applied for producing quasi-periodic stress on the FMF. The 532-nm green light from a frequency-doubled Nd:YVO 4 laser is launched into the fiber via an objective lens, and the output intensity distribution from the FMF is recorded by an optical beam profiler. Through the tuning of the polarization controllers, the input fundamental mode from the Nd:YVO 4 laser is selectively coupled to the higher-order modes in the FMF by the mechanically induced LPG.

III. RESULTS AND D ISCUSSION 

For a constant-period LPG generated by tuning the angle of the grooved plate against the axis of the straight optical fiber, the effective period Λeff of the gratings can be expressed as: 

Λ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = Λ 0/ cos 𝜃𝜃 , (1) 

where Λ0 is the period of V-grooves and θ is the angle between the fiber and the normal of grooves. The resonance wavelength λres and Λ eff are related by the phase-matching condition: 

𝜆𝜆 𝑟𝑟 𝑒𝑒 𝑟𝑟 = Λ 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 (𝑛𝑛 01 − 𝑛𝑛 11 ), (2) 

where n01 and n11 are the effective indices of the LP 01 and LP 11 modes, respectively. Therefore, the resonance wavelength can be adjusted by tuning Λeff or the effective index difference. By adjusting θ, we vary Λeff accordingly, and the resonance wavelength of LPG can be tuned [16]. On the other hand, the effective index difference can be changed by photo-elastic or thermo-optic effects [19] −[20]. 

Figure 3(a) shows the intensity profile of the vortex beam generated from the FMF. Fig. 3(b) is the interference pattern of the vortex beam and a reference beam generated with a small aperture. The spiral pattern verifies that an orbital angular momentum of  −ħ is carried by the vortex beam. An orbital angular momentum of  +ħ can also be achieved by tuning the PCs, as shown in Fig. 3(c). 

After proper adjustment of the polarization controllers, the vortex beam of Fig. 3 can be transformed into cylindrical vector beams with radial, azimuthal, or hybrid polarizations. Fig. 4 demonstrates  the intensity profiles of an azimuthally polarized vector beam after passing it through a linear polarizer with the transmission axis aligned vertically (0 °), and then rotated clockwise by 45 °, 90 °, and 135 °.

Figure 5 (a) and (b) show the intensity profiles of the fundamental mode and the higher-order mode in the FMF. The flat-top beam can be generated in a specific superposition of (a) and (b), as shown in (c). The distributions of optical intensity along the x- and y-axis respectively are depicted in (d) and (e). 

Figure 6 shows the density profiles of the fundamental beam, the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam for the setup in Fig. 2. (a)-(d) show the experimental measurements and (e)-(h) are the simulation results. The resonance wavelength 

λres of LPG is determined by the phase-matching condition: 

λres = Λeff (n1 − n2), where Λeff is the effective period of LPG, n1 and n2 are the effective indices of the fundamental and higher-order modes. The cutoff wavelength of HI1060 is about 920 nm, therefore, while operating at the wavelength 532 nm, it supports LP 01, LP 11 ,LP 02, and LP 21 modes. By tuning the angle of the grooved plate against the axis of optical fiber, the effective period of the gratings and the corresponding resonance wavelength can be

adjusted, while the effective index difference can be changed by photo-elastic or thermo-optic effects. 

The coupling efficiency between the fundamental mode and the higher-order mode is tuned by the stress on the LPG, while the resonance bandwidth is dependent on the force gradient along the fiber. The polarization controllers are used to adjust the fraction of optical power between the orthogonal polarizations as well as their relative phases. Figures 6(a)-(d) demonstrate the experimentally generated fundamental beam, the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam, and the simulation results of these beams by superposition of the four eigenmodes of this fiber are shown in Fig. 6(e)-(h). After comparing the experimental observations and the theoretical simulations, we find that the higher-order modes in this few-mode fiber have been successfully excited. 

V. CONCLUSION 

We have successfully generated tunable vortex, vector, and flat-top 1060-nm optical beams in a few-mode fiber with a mechanical long-period fiber grating. By the variation of applied force on the fiber grating, the core mode to higher-order mode excitation can be adjusted. We have also generated higher-order green light fields from a few-mode optical fiber by using a mechanically induced LPG and a 532-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser. The fundamental beam, the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam have been generated in the HI1060 fiber. This LPG is shown to be a versatile device for various spectral bands and fibers in the manipulation of transverse optical fields. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first demonstration of mechanically induced LPG in the manipulation of visible green light field in a few-mode optical fiber. Since the center wavelength, spectral bandwidth, and coupling efficiency of this LPG can be continuously adjusted over broad ranges, it will find many potential applications in the future.

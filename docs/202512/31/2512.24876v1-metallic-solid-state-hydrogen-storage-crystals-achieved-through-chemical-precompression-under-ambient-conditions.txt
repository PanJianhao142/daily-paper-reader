ABSTRACT 

Improving hydrogen storage density is essential for reducing the extreme conditions required in 

applications such as nuclear fusion.  However,  the  recognition  of metallic hydrogen as the “Holy 

Grail” of high -pressure science highlights the difficulty of high -density  hydrogen aggregation. 

Here, we report  a solid -state crystal H 9@C 20  formed by embedding hydrogen atoms into C 20 

fullerene cages  and utilizing chemical precompression, which remains stable under ambient 

pressure  and  temperature conditions and exhib its metallic properties. This precompression effect 

is reflected in the formation of C –H bonds within the cage and C –C bonds between cages, resulting 

in the transformation of all C atoms from sp 2 to sp 3 hybridization with inward and outward 

distortions, while promoting delocalized multicenter bonding within the H 9 aggregate. In particular, 

the hydrogen density inside  the  C20  cage exceeds that of solid hydrogen, achieving  a uniform 

discrete distribution with H 9 as monomers. Further  study  reveals that filling hydrogen molecules 

into voids between H 9@C 20  primitive cells can increase hydrogen content while maintaining 

structural stability, forming a solid –gas mixed hydrogen storage crystal. Our findings provide a 

basis for developing high -density hydrogen storage materials under  ambient conditions. 2

INTRODUCTION 

The efficient  storage of hydrogen has long been an  important  and even  central focus  in fields 

such as  physics , chemistry, materials, and  energy science. 1-4 In particular,  since metallic hydrogen 

has  been theoretically predicted, 5 its extremely high atomic density is considered to hold great 

potential for energy storage and as a nuclear fusion fuel .6,7  However, achieving the pressures  of 

hundreds of GPa required for its synthesis has long been extremely challenging ,8 and no 

universally recognized sample has yet been obtained. 9 More crucially,  hydrogen energy utilization, 

exemplified by nuclear fusion, typically operates under ambient pressure conditions .10,11  Th is

clearly  indicates  that  achieving the highest possible hydrogen  storage  density at low or even 

ambient pressures  represents an important direction for future development. 

Actually , t o overcome the bottleneck of high -pressure conditions, researchers have developed a 

synthetic pathway  that utilizes  the intrinsic pressure of chemical bonds to achieve chemical 

precompression, 12  enabling the metallization of hydrogen at lower pressures. 13,14  Representative 

systems such as H 3S and LaH 10  demonstrate metallization at approximately 150 -200 GPa, 15,16  far 

below those required for pure hydrogen, yet still too high for practical applications.  Meanwhile, 

since these structures generally contain elem ents with higher Z than hydrogen , which often leads 

to energy losses in hydrogen utilization ,17,18  their potential for practical applications is further 

reduced. This is also one of the important reasons why low -Z materials, such as hydrocarbon foams 

or high -density carbon shells, are commonly selected as fuel targets in inertial confinement fusion 

devi ces, including the National Ignition Facility. 19,20  Furthermore, for the application of hydrogen 

energy, such as in nuclear fusion, improving the absorption efficiency of externally injected energy 

is equally important, 21,22  and this usually requires high -density hydrogen aggregates to exhibit a 

uniform discrete distribution behavior.  Notably, ordered hydrogen distribution via organic 3

frameworks and fullerene surfaces offers a bottom -up perspective for this goal. 23 -27  Based  on these 

existing studies , develop ing  hydrogen storage crystals with  lo w-Z elements to achieve high storage 

density at low pressure and ensure a  uniform discrete distribution of hydrogen aggregates  is of 

great significance. 

As potential containers capable of hosting hydrogen, nanoscale confinement structures may 

offer unique advantages for achieving efficient hydrogen aggregation. It has been shown that C 80 

can stabilize molecular configuration that is unstable under ambient pressure and enhance 

intramolecular bond strength. 28  Similarly, hydrogen molecules have been embedded within C 60 .29 

However, since the cavity of C 60  is much larger than the size of hydrogen molecules, the interaction 

with the cage wall is weak, making it difficult for hydrogen molecules to dissociate or form high -

density aggregates, which is a key prerequisite for metallic hydrogen. 30  Meanwhile, embedding 

multiple hydrogen molecules  can  increase the internal pressure, ultimately destabilizing and 

rupturing the fullerene cage. 31 ,32  These studies seem to imply  that by utilizing strong bonding 

mechanisms, 33 ,34  atomic hydrogen can be embedded into smaller fullerene molecules, potentially 

achieving effective hydrogen aggregation under mild conditions. As the smallest fullerene, C 20  has 

always been challenging to synthesize, and its relatively low thermodynamic stability poses 

obstacles for practical applications. 35,36  However, it is worth noting that recent studies have shown 

that embedding atoms into C 20  for strong bonding can indeed improve its stability. 37  Moreo ver, as 

fullerene crystals have been widely predicted and even experimentally synthesized, 38 -40  the 

feasibility of using C 20  as a hydrogen storage unit to construct fullerene -based hydrogen storage 

crystals is greatly increased. Although no related studies have yet been found so far, this is what 

the present study aims to address. 

Here, we report a solid -state three -dimensional hydrogen storage crystal H 9@C 20 , whic h4

achieves  efficient hydrogen storage through chemical precompression and remains stable under 

ambient pressure  and  temperature conditions. Specifically, the formation of intra -cage C –H and 

inter -cage C –C bonds drives the transformation of  all  C atoms from sp 2 to  sp 3 hybridization, 

inducing a cooperative distortion of the C 20  framework that is crucial for the crystal’s stability. 

More importantly, this precompression effect suppresses hydrogen diffusion, leading to a 

hydrogen density exceeding that of solid hydrogen and enabling delocalized multicenter bonding, 

achieving a uni form  discrete distribution with H 9 as the uni t. Further electronic structure analyses 

reveal that H 9@C 20  crystal is metallic, defying the view that hydrogen is normally insulating or 

semiconducting under ambient conditions. Moreover, the voids between H 9@C 20  primitive cells 

can be further filled with hydrogen molecules to enhance the storage density.  Overall, our  findings 

lay the foundation  for achieving high -density hydrogen storage crystals under  ambient  conditions. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

To achieve the crystallization of high -density hydrogen aggregate within  C20  fullerenes, we 

perform extensive structural modeling and periodic optimization. Eventually, a stable H 9@C 20 

crystal is obtained, in which the H 9 aggregate  is  embedded  in  the C 20  cage . As shown in Figure 1 a,

within the  primitive cell, eight hydrogen atoms bond to the C 20  cage via C –H bonds,  while the 

remaining hydrogen atom resides at its center. The crystal belongs to a cubic structure in the highly 

symmetric space group  Pm -3m  (No. 221), with an equilibrium lattice constant of 5.52 Å  (detailed 

structural parameters are provided in Table S1). It is worth not ing  that the isolated C 20  fullerene 

consists of C atoms with sp 2 hybridization and exhibits an approximately spherical structu re, 35,41 

making it difficult to stack further into a stable three -dimensional crystal.  Importantly, the 

introduction of  hydrogen atoms  alters this situation by inducing the formation  of  C–H bonds, 

causing some C atoms to contract inward, while the remaining ones expand outward due to the 5

C-C bonds between cages together causes partial inward contraction and outward expansion of C atoms on C 20 . The

inter -cage C –C bonding. As a result, the C atoms, originally dominated by sp 2 hybridization, 

undergo an overall transformation to sp 3 hybridization, endowing the C 20  cage with the ability to 6

form three -dimensional covalent connections. Meanwhile, the hydrogen atoms are stabilized 

within the lattice through chemical bonding, thereby forming a solid -state hydrogen storage crystal. 

The change in hybridization type of C atoms on C 20  is also supported by orbital composition 

analysis  (Table S2 ). Where  the 2s orbital of each C atom undergoes compositional mixing with 

2p x, 2p y, and 2p z orbitals, leading to the formation of four bonds with sp 3 hybridization 

characteristics. T hus , adjacent H 9@C 20  primiti ve  cells in the supercell are interconnected via C –C

bonds (Figure 1b). Such covalent connections endow the crystal with remarkable structural 

stability. 

Remarkably, the optimized structure remains stable under ambient pressure , which sharply 

contrasts with the conventional view that hydrogen can only achieve effective aggregation  under 

high pressure.  This can be attributed to the complex interactions  within  the crystal composed of 

hydrogen and fullerene cages, thereby eliminating the need for external pressure. Interesting ly, 

whereas earlier studies concluded that small fullerenes such as C 20  have difficulty in incorporating 

hydrogen due to size limitations  and strong repulsion, 42  our  results reveal differences between 

periodic crystal effects and the behavior of isolated molecules, highlighting the complexity of the 

hydrogen storage mechanism in crystals. These phenomena require in -depth analysis to be fully 

understood. 

Based on the H 9@C 20  crystal structure, we evaluate its stability from dynamic, thermodynamic, 

and mechanical perspectives by calculating the phonon spectrum, conducting  ab  initio  molecular 

dynamics (AIMD) simulations, and determining its elastic constants. Figure 1 c shows the phonon 

dispersion curve in the first Brillouin zone. The absence of imaginary frequencies indicates that 

the structure is dynamically stable. From a thermodynamic perspective, we perform 10  ps  AIMD 

simulations at 300 K, and no obvious  fluctuations are observed in the total energy over time (Figure 7

1d). Furthermore, the radial distribution functions (RDF) show that both C –C and C –H bonds 

oscillate about their equilibrium positions (Figure 1e),  which  further confirms the thermodynamic 

stability at room temperature. To assess its mechanical properties, we calculate its elastic constants. 

For  system s with cubic symmetry, mechanical stability requires satisfying the Born -Huang criteria 

(c 11  > 0, c 44  > 0 and c 11 + 2c 12  > 0). 43  For H 9@C 20 , the calculated elastic constants are c 11  = 673.1 

GPa, c 12  = 35.6 GPa, and c 44  = 152.1 GPa, all of which meet the above criteria, thus confirming 

its mechanical robustness. Collectively, these indicators jointly demonstrate that the three -

dimensional H 9@C 20  crystal has excellent stability under ambient conditions. Furthermore, given 

the three -dimensional covalent connectivity of the C 20  cage structure, the  material is expected to 

exhibit excellent hardness. The calculation results  show that its bulk modulu s is 248.09 GPa and 

the shear modulus is 205.51 GPa (Table S3), indicating strong resistance to uniform compression 

and shear deformation. In the Vickers hardness test, H 9@C 20  achieved a hardness of 33.02 GPa. 

Although this value is lower than that of diamond (~92 GPa), 44  it exceeds that of conventional 

hard covalent materials such as SiC (28 GPa). 45  These results indicate that the H 9@C 20  crystal not 

only exhibits remarkable stability but also holds  the potential to be suitable for applications 

requiring hi gh hardness and deformation resistance. 

After confirming the stability of the crystal, we analyze its bonding mechanism using the 

electron localization function (ELF) and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) methods. As 

shown in Figure 2a, both the C –C bonds between primitive cells and the  C–H bonds within the 

primitive cell exhibit electron localization, thereby confirming the formation of covalent bonds. 

This bonding feature agrees with the chemical precompression theory, 12  wherein the internal 

compressive effect generated by chemical bon ding enables hydrogen atoms to form a dense 

arrangement similar to that under high -pressure conditions, and enhance the overall structural 8

stability. Notably, appreciable multicenter electron delocalization is clearly observed between the 

central hydrogen atom and the eight hydrogen  atoms  that are bonded to the C atoms (H 8). 

Continuous yellow -green regions (ELF  ∼ 0.5) appear between the hydrogen atoms, in contrast to 

the typical deep -blue, isolated interatomic regions. Such a distribution indicates that the electron 

cloud extends across atomic boundaries, forming a delocalized electronic state. This feature 9

resembles the electronic behavior of metallic hydrogen, 5,46  further suggesting that the chemical 

precompression effect enables hydrogen atoms to effectively aggregate. Additionally, COHP 

analysis of the C –C bonds in the H 9@C 20  crystal shows that, below the Fermi level, the bonding 

orbitals are stronger than the antibonding ones, with an integrated COHP (ICOHP) value of  -4.45 

eV, indicating the formation of covalent bonds (Figure 2b). Similarly, the C –H bonds also exhibit 

strong  bonding characteristics, with  an ICOHP value of  -3.82 eV. Between hydrogen atoms, 

bonding orbitals dominate, indicating an attractive interaction (ICOHP =  -0.51 eV) that facilitates 

electron delocalization across atomic boundaries, thereby forming a metal -like hydrogen state. 

To quantitatively elucidate the contributions of different attractive interactions to the stability 

of the H 9@C 20  crystal, we conduct an energy decomposition analysis (EDA). As shown in Figure 

2c,  the orbital interaction  dominates the attractive interaction between  the  H8 and the C 20  cage, 

accounting for 75.1%, which is higher than the contributions from electrostatic interaction (24.1%) 

and dispersion interaction (0.8%). This result confirms orbital hybridization and covalent bond 

formation between C and hydrogen atoms. Moreover,  orbital interaction  also dominates the 

interactions between adjacent primitive cells (70 .9%), consistent with the covalent crystal 

characteristics revealed by ELF and COHP analyses. Notably, the stability of the central hydrogen 

atom arises primarily from its orbital interaction with the H 8, contributing 63.2% of the total 

attractive interaction, which indicates orbital overlap between the hydrogen atoms. Th ese 

conclusions are further supported by the results of the  interaction region indicator (IRI) analysis. 

As shown in Figure 2d, an attractive interaction exists between the H 8 and the C ato ms, and this 

interaction also exists between the H 8 and the central hydrogen atom. In addition, under the 

influence of chemical precompression, the C 20  cage framework becomes stable and exerts steric 

hindrance effect on its interior, which also promoting the stability of the central hydrogen atom. 10 

Nevertheless, the stability of the central hydrogen atom is fundamentally determined by the orbital 

interactions between the hydrogen atoms. 

It is worth mentioning that the density of the H 9 aggregate inside the C 20  cage is 0.29 g/cm³ ,

which is higher than that of solid hydrogen (~0.086 g/cm³). 47  More importantly, this study is based 

on a fullerene structure and achieves a three -dimensional solid hydrogen storage crystal through 

chemical precompression. In this system, hydrogen atoms exhibit a highly aggregated state with 

characteristics similar to  metallic hydrogen, which is distinct from previous approaches that relied 

on hydrogen adsorption on fullerene molecules. 25 -27  This discovery may provide new opportunities 

for the utilization of hydrogen energy, including nuclear fusion reactions.  In addit ion, the uniform 

discrete distribution of hydrogen fuel and the use of low -Z elements can potentially enhance fuel 

utilization efficiency and the absorption of externally injected energy. 10,20  In our work, although 

the hydrogen storage  gravimetric density in this system does not reach that of some existing 

hydrogen storage materials due to remaining voids  between H 9@C 20  primitive cells , under ambient 

conditions this system achieves a uniform discrete distribution as well as high -density 

encapsulation of  hyd rogen  atoms within C 20  cage composed solely of low -Z element. This 

configuration offers enormous potential for improving fuel utilization efficiency and enhancing 

the  absorption  of external energy during fusion and other processes. Furthermore, it is evident that 

filling these voids can further enhance hydrogen storage density and improve related performance, 

which requires more extensive and in -depth exploration in multiple aspec ts in the future. Therefore, 

the crystal we design can serve as a fundamental  conceptual model and become  the basis for further 

development of hydrogen storage. 

In order to elucidate the electronic structure properties of the H 9@C 20  crystal, high -precision 

band  structure and density of states (DOS) calculations are performed. As shown in Figure 3a, the 11

valence band of the H 9@C 20  crystal crosses the Fermi level, indicating metallic properties under 

ambient conditions. Further DOS analysis supports this conclusion. The total DOS  (TDOS) near 

the Fermi level is continuously distributed, satisfying the electron state density condition for metal 

conduction (Figure 3b). Projected DOS (PDOS) analysis  re veals that the electronic states near the 

Fermi level are primarily derived from C atoms, while hydrogen atoms also exhibit metallic 

behavior. Notably, this finding contradict s the conventi onal view that hydrogen typically behaves 

as an insulator or semiconductor in the solid state,  48,49  highlighting that chemical precompression 

effect can endow hydrogen with unique electronic behavior. Furthermore, since the central 

hydrogen atom in the H 9@C 20  structure does not directly form a chemical bond with the C atoms, 

we  also  perform a comparative study of the H 8@C 20  crystal. The phonon dispersion curve in the 

first Brillouin zone shows no imaginary frequencies (Figure S1), indicating that this stru cture is 

also dynamically stable. Further analysis of the band structure and  DOS shows that H 8@C 20 

exhibits semiconducting behavior (Figures S2 and S3). This comparison highlights the crucial role 12 

of the central hydrogen  atom in enabling the crystal to exhibit metallic properties. 

To elucidate the  formation mechanism of H 9@C 20  under ambient conditions, we analyze the 

orbitals  contributing to the interaction between H 9 and C 20 . An H 9@C 20  fragment with C 4v  point 

group symmetry is extracted from the H 9@C 20  crystal, and the composition of its occupied orbitals 

is examined.  As shown in Fig ure  4a, t he energy level diagram reveal s that the orbitals of the H 9

aggregate play a crucial role in bond formation within the H 9@C 20  fragment. Specifically, the A1 

orbitals of the H 9 aggregate interact with the orbitals of the C 20  structural framework in the low -

energy region, forming the A1 bonding orbitals of H 9@C 20 . This orbital coupling enhances the 

bonding stability of  the H 9@C 20  fragment. Moreover, the E orbitals of the H 9 aggregate also 

participate in bonding interactions with the C 20  framework orbitals in the higher -energy region, 

further promoting the  formation of H 9@C 20  (the detail s in Table S4). Overall, these results 

demonstrate that the orbitals of the H 9 aggregate play a key role in the formation of the H 9@C 20 

monomer. 

Next, to more accurately examine the electronic behavior of the H 9 aggregate within the C 20 

cage, we perform local molecular orbital (LMO) analysis to reveal its electronic distribution, 

thereby determining how it participates in chemical bonding. As shown in Figure 4b, LMO s based 

on the H 9 aggregate present delocalized multicenter bonding, consistent with the delocalized 

multicenter electron density revealed by ELF and previous findings on stability via such bonding. 50 

Subsequently, we select the largest d iagonal cross - section defined  by the central hydrogen atom 

and four adjacent edge hydrogen atoms to analyze its electron density distribution.  The critical 

electron density corresponding to the van der Waals radius of hydrogen was first determined, and 

integration of the electron density over all hydrogen atoms yielded the corresponding critical value 

ρ(r vdW ) = 0.0158 e·Å -3. This critical value is used as a standard for quantifying the degree of 13

electron delocalization in the H 9 system and is presented in Figure 4c as the electron distribution 

contour. It can be observed that the H 9 aggregate exhibits a continuous electron density distribution, 

with the electron cloud spanning the boundaries of multiple hydrogen atoms and forming clear 

delocalized multicenter feature, consistent with the LMO results above. 

Furthermore, to quantitatively characterize the spatial extent of this delocalized orbital, we 

calculate its RDF. Figure 4d shows that its main RDF peaks fall within the 0 -1.8  Å range, with the 

approximately 1.2  Å distance between the central hydrogen and the top hydrogen lying within this 

interval, thereby further supporting the conclusion that delocalized multicenter bonding  exists in 

the system. More importantly, the distance from the central hydrogen atom to the vertex hydrogen 

atoms is noticeably small er than the H –H separations in some metal hydrides and in hydrogen 14 

under high pressure,  51,52  indicating that the chemical precompression effect can cause the H 9

aggregate to exhibit a highly compressed state  under  ambient conditions. In addition, unlike the 

previously reported cubic C 20  crystal, 53  our study reveals that the embedded hydrogen atoms can 

induce a cooperative deformation of the isolated C 20  fullerene, thereby forming a densely packed 

solid -state hydrogen storage crystal under ambient conditions.  Overall, the combined analyses of 

LMO, spatial electron density,  and RDF systematically and precisely  depict the delocalized 

multicenter properties of the H 9 aggregate within the C 20  cage. 

In terms of  preparation method s, although the direct synthesis of such a high -density hydrogen 

storage crystal at ambient pressure is highly challenging, a feasible strategy may involve high -

pressure synthesis followed by stabilization under ambient conditions . Previous experiments have 

successfully synthesized carbon nitride and boron nitride crystals using this method ,54,55  and even 

achieved the insertion of hydrogen atoms into the carbon nitride framework and the stable recovery 

under ambient pressure. 56  Of course, this also includes  different practical possible preparation 

techniques. For example, in situ bottom -up growth can be achieved by precisely controlling the 

elemental stoichiometry under high can be achieved by precisely controlling the elemental 

stoichiometry under high  pressure. 57,58  Alternatively, pre -synthesized C 20  cage structures can be 

combined with hydrogen, and crystal growth promoted through infiltration and related techniques 

under high pressure.  59  With the continued advancement of related experimental techniques, the 

synthesis of high -density hydrogen storage crystals proposed in this study is becoming 

increa singly promising. 

Considering the presenc e of lattice voids in the H 9@C 20  crystal, we evaluate its potential for 

further  enhancing hydrogen storage density. Specifically, without changing the framework of th is 

solid hydrogen storage crystal, we investigate the feasibility of filling different numbers of 15 

Figure 5.  Optimized geometric structure and stability analysis of the H 9@C 20 ·4H 2 crystal.  (a)  Schematic diagram of

the primitive cell.  (b)  Supercell of the H 9@C 20 ·4H 2 crystal. Four hydrogen molecules are stably located in the voids

hydrogen molecules into  the  voids between H 9@C 20  primitive cells. After high -precision structural 

relaxation,  the results show that the crystal  can  remain stable under ambient pressure until four 

hydrogen molecules  are  filled (detailed structural parameters are provided in Table S5). 

Taking the filling of four hydrogen molecules as an example, we analyze the dynamic and 

thermodynamic properties. As shown in Figure 5 a and 5b, these four hydrogen molecules are 16 

stably distributed in the regions between adjacent primitive cells (detailed structural are provided 

in Figure S4). Further ELF analysis reveals that these embedded hydrogen molecules have not 

undergone any chemical bond rearrangement and exhibit no electr onic overlap with H 9@C 20 

(Figure S5). These results suggest that their stability primarily originates from van der Waals 

interactions. No imaginary frequencies  are  found in the phonon spectrum throughout the first 

Brillouin zone, confirming the dynamical s tability of the H 9@C 20 ·4H 2 crystal (Figure 5c). 

Additionally, at 300 K, the 10 ps AIMD simulations reveal no obvious fluctuation in total energy 

over time, further confirming its thermodynamic stability (Figure 5d). In terms of hydrogen storage 

performance, this design increases th e gravimetric density from 3.6 wt% in the base model to 6.6 

wt%, while maintaining stability under ambient conditions. In summary,  in  the H 9@C 20 ·4H 2

crystal , the original solid -state hydrogen storage framework is completely preser ved, and the bond 

in the filled hydrogen molecule  is  not broken either. Thus, a hybrid solid –gas hydrogen storage 

mechanism is achieved , which further provides a potential approach for designing high -density 

and stable hydrogen storage materials under ambient conditions. 

CONCLUSION 

Achieving effi cient hydrogen aggregation under ambient conditions is crucial.  We have 

proposed a strategy for embedding hydrogen atoms into C 20  fullerene  cage s to form a solid -state 

three -dimensional hydrogen storage crystal. Obviously, this hydrogen storage pathway offers four 

major advantages: stability  under  ambient pressure  and  temperature  condi tions, solid -state  and 

high -density storage,  uniform  discrete  distribution and low -Z composition . Through systematic 

analyses of the electronic structure and dynamics, the stability mechanism derived from chemical 

precompression has been elucidated. Specifically, the formation of C –H covalent bonds causes 

some C atoms  to contract inward, while the formation of inter -cage C –C covalent bonds causes 17 

the remaining ones to expand outward. This collaborative effect plays a crucial role in the 

formation of the H 9@C 20  crystal. The resulting chemical precompression significantly shortens the 

H–H distances compared to those in conventional hydrides, leading to multicenter bonding within 

the H 9 aggregate, whose delocalized electronic behavior closely resembles that of metallic 

hydrogen under high pressure. Additionally, the primitive cells are interconnected through C –C

covalent bonds, thereby endowing the cry stal with excellent mechanical strength. 

To elucidate the role of the central hydrogen atom, we have compared the electronic properties 

of H 8@C 20 . This  crystal exhibits semiconducting behavior, whereas H 9@C 20  displays metallic 

behavior under ambient conditions, demonstrating the critical role of the central hydrogen in 

triggering the semiconductor -to -metal transition. Moreover, based on the voids identified in the 

H9@C 20  crystal, we also have constructed a mixed hydrogen storage system that combines atomic 

and molecular hydrogen. These findings contribute an important  foundation for the design of high -

density hydrogen storage materials that can remain stab le under  ambien t conditions.
